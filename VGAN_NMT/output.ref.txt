comfortable and relaxing environment we were seated right away the waiter new their beer selection well the brisket nachos were a fantastic blend of unexpected flavors sweet bbq sauce fresh cilantro and a tiny bit of heat from jalape o the whisky infused chocolate cake is a must have
this place is great we ve eaten here a few times and have never been disappointed very authentic flavors with noodles made in house i ve had several different dishes here and all have been spectacular my favorite dish is the spicy wonton noodles it has a great balance of flavor with the right amount of heat the pork soup dumplings are also not to be missed they are warm and hearty and have great texture the service is fast and friendly and they turn tables over quickly if you haven t eaten here yet definitely give it a try
this place isn t the most authentic and definitely falls into the shitty chinese category what i lovingly call chinese places that have a menu catered towards an american audience but it has never failed to hit the spot yummy yummy is our go to place for take out chinese their delivery is fast and doesn t get lost the same way some other delivery people do meaning that our food is still hot when we get it the delivery people are also always friendly the food is always tasty with good portions definitely <unk> the itch for me and my s o before yummy yummy my rule of thumb was that any restaurant that called itself yummy or delicious or good was none of the above but yummy yummy really breaks that mold
chips and salsa cost with no refills on small portions pitcher of margaritas suppose to fill glasses didn t even fill food marginally ok service slow won t be back
<unk> for <unk> okay so the <unk> group cafe insert name of one of different milwaukee locations is no big news to me i lived right down the street from the cafe <unk> location in bay view and while the meal was always solid it was nothing special however they do make a bloody good bloody mary and i was hankering for some booze on this particular evening after seeing <unk> at the lovely sundance theater my best gal pal and i headed over on a <unk> winters eve around min wait ah what okay i m not the kind of gal who usually waits that long i m usually always mad hangry and need to eat immediately i decided to stick it out for the bloody mary s atmosphere one word loud as fuck i was yelling at my friend the whole evening went home hoarse bloody ordered the godfather which is a caprese bloody so darn good also dollars literally cost more than me meal food eh average ordered a warm hummus plate which was described as warm hummus roasted veggies and pita didn t realize the veggies were piled on top of the warm hummus as opposed to use for dipping wasn t practical but taste was decent ordered a cone of frites and got fries i m sure they are still working themselves out but frites are from my humble understanding supposed to be twice fried crispy lil things these were big ol <unk> things with tons of potato delicious but not frites to top off the average evening we were sat upstairs which has a glass window on top i m assuming which can be moved for warm weather great idea but drafty as heck on a degree mile an hour wind night also we were seated next to a lovely family with children all of whom were running around like god dang <unk> while the parents ignored the children running into waitresses get your <unk> seed under control madison overall eh food is okay booze is great but the atmosphere made the evening far less enjoyable then it could have been
i went with a group of girlfriend of us all together we got there around pm and were only greeted with that booth is reserved so we kindly moved to another area at the time there was one employee and maybe people inside already sitting and enjoying themselves she didn t seem to happy to be there she didn t acknowledge or even smile the service is ridiculously slow i m not sure if it was because the waitress found us intimidating or something else but she never came to our table they didn t have the flavours we actually wanted so we ended up picked other it took the waitress minutes to bring the pipes we got our own menus from the bar wrote our food and drink orders on a pice of paper then gave it to her proceeded to wait minutes for the food to arrive by that time a new waiter had come in to help the waitress and food and service got better not the best but better even our waitress from earlier was nicer the atmosphere is pretty chill lots of spaces with plenty of seats a big tv to keep you instead the food is pretty good too we ll probably go again if we have nothing better to do
good food great service love the fry sauce and really love that they leave a bottle of fry sauce and or ranch at the table for you prices are really reasonable as well
the best part about this place was the great service the owner his son and our waitress were extremely attentive the food is definitely on the heavier side but it was good i would definitely recommend trying it its a small place but it has a line out the door on sunday my boyfriend had a fried sandwich and i had their version of the reuben the prices were extremely reasonable i will definitely be back
this place is fantastic i love the ambiance the people and the food we had <unk> as our server and she was sooo amazing loved her she s fun bubbly and personable the only reason why this place didn t get a this place really should get is because the hostess at the front was less than <unk> to see me as a customer not sure why but anyhow this place is bomb bomb bomb bomb you must come here and ask to be at <unk> s table
my family and i used to go here at least time per week not sure what has happened but this place has gone down hill everything in this place is filthy the trash cans are always over flowing the tables are cake with old food floor looks like a college party just came through and the <unk> and this is what you can see just imagine what the back of the house looks like needless to say we will not be back
the bar food is ok what i really like is that it s a great place to meet with friends for happy hour your check never makes you cringe the drinks are poured well and the staff is friendly it s perfect for my tastes
i m pretty picky about ramen so i can t give it any more than stars but if you re looking for something that s good enough this place fits the bill plus there isn t any good ramen in cleveland so if you re really craving ramen just come here if you re nearby
i was disappointed we had a reservation and wasn t served our meal until the wait staff only checked on us once when my meal came it wasn t even what i ordered when the waiter said he d check to see how long to remake it he said it d be another mins won t go back
we felt like a nuisance to the staff just getting our orders check beer selection was modest and the food was pricey for the quality i d avoid this place if you re in a aspinwall but then again what are you doing in aspinwall in the first place
i can t believe how the people can rate this place so high first just past year this location used to be a burger joint every year for the past to years they had to change restaurants due to poor business decor of this steakhouse hasn t changed from when they <unk> to be a burger joint if you are looking for a classy steakhouse atmosphere this isn t it second this is considered a high end steakhouse most of the upscale steakhouse with in strip uses prime cut here they use choice <unk> and charges for prime price we had center cut new york steak and bone in ribeye for dinner it was the worst they were both so fatty half of the oz steak was that of fat for new york steak there were multiple <unk> going through surrounded by layers of fat based on this we probably could have a better steak from outback steakhouse for the of the price of this place third they were playing a music in the steakhouse they seems to be using the same sound track as the casino s <unk> ever heard of music being played at a steakhouse fourth <unk> cheap furniture that was used when it was the burger joint if you are looking for a good steakhouse i would not recommend this place there are a lot better place for good steaks than <unk> you can go to <unk> at <unk> old homestead at caesars even the sterling steak house at bally s was better this crap they call steak at center cut steakhouse and ruth chris just opened up at harrahs go everywhere else but here i am sure like all the other <unk> that went out of business at this location this steakhouse will follow very soon
awesome place to get some nice food before going on somewhere else everything on the menu is the kind of food you can eat and then go on to do more drinking the pizzas are awesome great crust fresh flavors and a good size the salads are good too except the chopped vegetable salad which had flavors primarily the overwhelming pickled something gross that did not work for me at all the menu description made it sounds like a cheese cream salad and instead it was very dry with a strange combination of vegetables asparagus pickled onions pickled something green that was so salty it hurt i don t recall tasting feta or creamy garlic at all the other salads at my table green chinese chicken looked amazing though can t go wrong with the pizza <unk> the cocktails are very good here too with fresh fruit ingredients and a strong pour i really liked the banana cheesecake
best lengua tacos i ve had in vegas so far my husband got the nachos and chicago fries they where both delicious as well the owner or manager waiter were really friendly
i had the california chicken sandwich and it was very very good the bread was fresh and soft the cheese was milky and perfect the chicken was moist and tasty the restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was calming the staff was extremely nice and attentive going back again tomorrow it was that good i highly recommend this gem
if you re feeling hungry this is the place to go they have large portions and you can add on one of their signature pancake items for just a few more dollars i ve been here a few times and they somehow seem to make a mistake on the order each time the cooks screwed up is the excuse if you can get past the spotty service the food is pretty darn tasty
we visited here first time and i wish we had come here earlier this is an awesome place for simple reasonable price food in las vegas their thali and parathas are delicious it is also a grocery store so that is added bonus we also tried their dal <unk> and it was amazing lot of fresh sweets and snacks offered as well great place to grab a quick bite in las vegas close to the strip
we were walking down mount pleasant one day and saw that this restaurant opened up we ve tried all the other italian restaurants around yonge mount pleasant eglinton so we wanted to try this one as well just the other day we remembered it and went for dinner it was an excellent meal we started with the calamari shrimp fried artichoke and it was very delicious in particular the shrimp was wonderfully seasoned and lightly breaded and fried to perfection i only wish there was more of it i had the penne con vodka for dinner and it was also very delicious i love cream tomato sauce and this sauce surpassed my expectations for dessert we had the home made donuts which were decadent and delightful there were three donuts one filled with lemon sauce one with berry sauce and one with chocolate overall an excellent meal the atmosphere and service were also lovely and the owner came by to make sure we were having a good time a great little restaurant my only criticism was that they played the same classical song on repeat the whole night it took a while to notice but once we did we could only wonder why they only played one song regardless i would most definitely go back
good food can get crowded at regular meal times staff is very friendly and it is a clean place to eat worth the stop
chino bandido is an asian mex infusion the staff is very helpful and sweet they recommended the tastiest i ordered and will only be ordering the combination plate that feeds a hun dry stomach generously the options were plentiful if you prefer a bit of spicy i recommend jade chicken pinto beans jerk fried rice and machaca quesadilla
this is my first review on yelp as i will be writing a few reviews today of all the taiwanese restaurants here in gta if you are taiwanese and you speak taiwanese you will get the meaning of the name right away this is now my favorite taiwanese restaurant in the gta the food here is very good i ve had the popcorn chicken fried <unk> breast with noodle fried pork chop with noodle minced pork on rice taiwanese sausage fried tofu cup chicken best in gta all the dishes were well proportioned and if you are from taiwan you will definitely like the taste very authentic the way they deep fry the chicken breast and the pork chop is just like the night market in taipei the snow ice is as good as it gets and i am surprised at how big of a bowl they serve you the whole family can share one i read here that people complain about service just to be fair i never just a restaurant on the service as you don t always get the same server you might have a good one the first time and a bad one the second time but <unk> the good food because of service is a waste of a meal i give it a out of
spent the week in toronto for business and went here for dinner have to say the reviews of this place are perplexing they uniformly complain about the long wait times bad service and over priced food many reviews offset this with kudos for the food itself not my experience at all i found the service to be fast extremely friendly the waitress was extremely <unk> with this american <unk> <unk> made me feel pretty groovy furthermore the food was wonderful a little pricey yes but i m only too happy to pay a premium for great food the big grind a this is a phenomenal burger extremely tasty with nice <unk> marks and flavor the ratio of meat to everything else was very very very good not too much meat and not too little lettuce tomato and onions were fresh and vibrant cheese was sharp cheddar groovy poutine a this was my first poutine canadians are very proud of this food i will never eat it again because i want to live to a ripe old age but i was in heaven eating it well that s my food review for this place both of my food stuffs were a so that means this place is as good as it gets as far as i m concerned how anyone can say the food is tasteless is beyond me weird personally i thought this place was fantastic
got the blue burger which was a pretty darn good burger i am not the biggest fan of fries but they were thin and crispy and had almost no taste of grease which made them good my boss got the french onion soup and short rib special which he absolutely loved i have eaten here in the past and also left happy if not for the slow ordering service it would get stars but they were very good and making sure we had utensils and refilled drinks
biggest won tons with real shrimp you can see and huge fish balls where you can taste real fish egg noodles cooked to perfection food appears almost as soon as you order great value and quality
the food at <unk> is full of flavor and tastes great the problems are that it takes forever to get the food and smoothies also we asked for a side of mustard and there was a <unk> mustard it was a dollar so it didn t break the bank but paying for mustard was a new experience for me my husband and i aren t vegan or vegetarian but we are trying to eat healthier and this is a decent start for us if you have time to spare and don t care about the old <unk> couches or very small tables this stop itthe flavor makes it worth it for us and we live nearby
the entire staff greeted us when we walked in they were friendly attentive i love that the kitchen is open for you to see them cook the food came out quickly hand down best taco i ve had in vegas so far my only complaint is the size for the amount of people in there it s pretty small but even with limited space we will be back
the salsa is by no means hot but always taste fresh and delicious as for the notorious margaritas i think they are now but still definitely get you messed up and are tasty enough for only bucks it puts some people off that the margaritas are poured from a tap like a draft beer but once you have two or three you are fine with it i witnessed such a lady make an issue with the draft margarita who insisted on having it shaken in a cocktail shaker the bartender reassured the <unk> that this was the house margarita that everyone was enjoying she just couldn t wrap her head around it i wanted to say listen lady its and it will get you <unk> up just enjoy it but my reserved nature <unk> otherwise the atmosphere and the food are above average standard sonora mexican fare that is not very spicy the location is ideal if your <unk> s girlfriend is having a baby at john c <unk> hospital and you want to have the holy shit your a dad talk over pitchers of margaritas because when you are done he can just walk back over to the <unk> <unk> while you finish your green chile quesadilla
great breakfast experience there the food is amazing just as the service the chicken apple sausage was just amazing as well as there pancakes wish i would have had the biscuits and gravy because everyone seemed to rave about them but just hit my food limit so definitely a next time experience if visiting arizona like i am i suggest this place for sure
fish are fresh but they are charging for hot tea for cup the food is good but way over price
wanting to get a quick breakfast in our hotel before hitting the pool my friend and i decided to make our way downstairs to the crepe place when we arrived there was a line but not too unbearably long the line however took a deceptively long time once we finally got our crepes they were pretty good my friend ordered the bananas foster crepe and i got the tomato and cheese crepe both of these crepes were very good
i ve been going to <unk> since i was years old that was years ago i still love it a lot even when i was in high school i would sometimes frequent this place twice a day while that may seem a little excessive you have to understand this place was part of my childhood and the best part in years nothing has changed same recipes same taste i think i just talked myself into going see ya there lol
atmosphere out of service out of go amy although the girls at the front were rude knocked a star off food out of had the chateau <unk> med rare and it was delightful parking out of value out of somewhat pricey for the cb good for special events
these crepes are delicious i have been to many crepe places but this one has been the best i have only tried the sweet ones but i bet the savory are fantastic as well
this place is super <unk> was getting ready to make a delivery and saw that i was waiting in line while everyone else was busy and came over in a matter of seconds to take my <unk> job guys
really good pho i have had nothing buy pho here i keep wanting to get something else but i can t i take that back i ordered egg rolls once they were good but i couldn t finish my <unk> worth it
awesome staff i recommend the strawberry mochi and the pho is good the hot pot is good as well
been going here for years now my favorite italian place in arizona this place is a gem chicken parm sub is my favorite and they have rainbow cookies that are delish
i have actually visited the village seafood buffet at the rio three times each time i have enjoyed myself i was torn on whether to give this or stars the reasons i chose is because when i want a plethora of seafood i know i can come here and have good eats but it is on the expensive side the options are always solid and depending on the visit the choices can vary just a bit expect to wait in line for a bit and come with a very empty belly you will want to get the most for your money
i eat here regularly food is consistently great the staff are really nice only negative is that they usually run out of stuff by the evening get there early so not to miss out
number buffet in vegas yea right i thought the buffet was just alright nothing really special the decor reminded me of buffets in reno for lunch on a monday was worth the price but i just didnt think it was that good the only thing i thought it was cool was burger sliders overall i thought the buffet was nothing special
this place was great the only other cuban food i ve ever had was when my wife made cuban sandwiches so i can t really compare to much i did try both their cuban sandwiches meatball and regular loved them both fries were outstanding too sat outside on a really nice day to eat service was great and i was given a free cuban coffee which was out of this world too
decent food fast prompt service by the staff that are not very friendly or accommodating overall decent value mongolian beef was good pasta with shrimp was fair duck breast was good well worth a visit
the food here is spectacular i ordered the waygu special with the foie supplement and the b arnaise sauce the steak was the best i have had in my life if not the best dish in my life this is the only place in pittsburgh the serves true french cuisine at an elevated level my only gripe was the frites aren t severed with an aioli i had to request it i had a country pate for an appetizer along side warm olives and a locally baked baguette the atmosphere is spot on with beautiful decor and most seats have a great view of the chefs working the pass again the only reason for my four star review as <unk> to the five was our service our server was at our table every minuets i appreciate attentive service but she asked us if we wanted to order the souffl four times because it takes minuets to bake i almost ordered it out of spite
well nook in arcadia has been one of my favorite places in phoenix but this location is on a whole other level of amazing the attention to detail in the atmosphere is <unk> i appreciate some of the historic hotel elements incorporated into the modern d cor it still maintains the cozy welcoming italian home vibe that nook is all about come to the table and let s savor an amazing meal and enjoy each others company kinda vibe the service is excellent and the food just wows you chef nick <unk> is a culinary genius do yourself a favor and don t skip dessert get the affogato yes even after lunch i assure you you ll get more work done
i loved everything i had chips salsa had a fresh quality to them with a little kick i had two tacos huge after the first i didn t think the second could match it but it did go to this place and you will get the feel that you discovered a gem and a go to place
greenland is located at the northeast corner of spring mountain and rainbow and has a pretty nice selection of korean food and merchandise of all the asian markets in las vegas greenland is the cleanest and has one of the best deals of prepared korean boneless short ribs
we really enjoyed the insalata della casa with balsamic vinaigrette and the toscana pizza we really enjoy a thin cracker like crust the white sangria was a disappointment though it was not very sweet and tasted weak watered down all in all a good dining experience we will return to try out other fare
mmmmmmmm <unk> so these guys have great things going for them ample space stupid friendly baristas incredibly priced java and tea a menu that makes me indecisive so many choices a good locations downtown yet off the beaten path and then there s a few things that don t jive with me internet situation two hour coded time limits pasty but you know what i just won t order pastry and hope it s going to be the best thing i put in my mouth and i ll deal with the fact that after two hours i m going to have to go back up to the register and get another little code thingy the bottomless cup of coffee is way worth it to me as are the tea options the <unk> the mocha the tables the windows the the
delicious and i love that literally everything in my calzone was local and plus who puts <unk> mushrooms in calzones come on <unk> star just for that
this place is gross stay away the food was so bad the service mediocre i only took small bites of everything and i spit it right out i will never go back to this place
i go here a few times a month very friendly staff and the food is good too i love my chipotle steak burritos very much
lunch is solved everyday noodles is a bustling traditional style noodle house located on busy forbes ave in squirrel hill walking into the shop reminded me of hip clean and comforting places in japan and korea the friendly staff quickly came over greeting us and getting our drink orders as per the norm i went with hot tea and water the jasmine tea is served in the newer <unk> tea bag and is very good the food though is why many of you are reading this review and here goes we shared the potstickers which were legit no frozen dumplings steamed in a microwave these were hand made then straight up stuck to an <unk> pot and steamed traditionally so that you get the crispy starch <unk> between each delicious dumpling if that wasn t enough i had a hankering for some broth i ordered the braised beef tendon noodle soup with the wide flat noodles the broth was rich yet clean full of flavor and balance the handmade noodles had the perfect chew and the portion was too much not a complaint you then must know that the meat was plentiful and flavorful thin slices of beef and chewy chunks of satisfying tendons <unk> in the amazing broth prices are right too
this place was insane kids all over the place screaming falling down throwing food i ve never seen such chaos we came for the pizza with no children called for take out we were put on hold for minutes by the time we arrived the girl finally took us off hold to take our order we paid and waited they told us it would take minutes we checked on our pizza around minutes they said it was almost done at minutes they handed us a pizza that had been sitting on the counter the entire time it was cold and hard they told us they would give us another pizza for our troubles we had ordered to go and had people at home waiting on us bad service chaotic environment won t be coming back
ok food is not stellar but not bad at all totally edible we came here for a friend s birthday well the start of the birthday i ll write the review of the strip club later girls guys and had an amazing time the atmosphere was amazing granted we showed up completely trashed to begin with but we had a ton of fun got a table right up near the stage and the birthday girl was immediately treated to a lap dance or two from some of the male servers our waitress who s name i dont remember was fucking hilarious just yelling at us and throwing shit our way at one point when i started mouthing off back to her she actually got up in my face and went nose to nose with me despite all this she managed to take really good care of us and knew exactly when to be a dick and when to be serious about her job and refill our drinks and what not keep in mind this place is not for the easily offended but if you go in knowing what to expect ie hats <unk> that you have a tiny dick or that your <unk> whistle s in the wind you will have a great time
it s a new restaurant it s obviously growing and going through learning <unk> it s apparent with the new waitstaff too but that should detract from its potential yes it was expensive to try yes i learned to be patient but i somehow felt it was nice the food was spot on the server was friendly but albeit slow and somewhat forgetful delivered the wrong dessert but more than made up for it by comping it and bringing the requested one all in all the food was flavorful and tasty the atmosphere was rustic yet modern and the waitstaff were trying give it a try but expect to not be wowed opening a restaurant takes time and patience the least you can do is help them help you besides if nothing else my burger was juicy and delicious while my salad was refreshing and hey when i bumped into my waitress the next day and <unk> her on my tables order she nailed it how she remembered that no one will know keep up the good work i ll be back soon to be wowed
gotta love this place where else at am after a night of drunken debauchery can you go and eat onion rings and or pancakes the food is what you would expect diner style i love the retro neon decor and the service is always good in particular the waitress dallas for some reason i always seemed to end up in her section which is awesome ive never been to the lounge side but ive never really had a need to perhaps one day great place i hope it continues to run strong for several more decades and not give in to the corporate sprawl of the strip
five stars for beer two stars for everything else let s cut to the chase the reason to come to fat heads is the beer list they have a nice combination of their own brews and other local craft beers on tap their head hunter ipa is particularly worthy of trying but all the fat heads beers are good i m not sure what the people who think fat heads has great burgers are thinking in my experience they are average at best tremont tap house <unk> brew <unk> s b spot and <unk> all have far better burgers as well as beer that s every bit as good as fat heads on one visit i was also served a <unk> wilted salad which there is just no excuse for service is average for being a brewery many of the servers seem to know <unk> little about beer that said food and drinks were delivered promptly and as ordered one of my main complaints about fat heads is the space it s huge and not in a good way it s awkwardly laid out there are tvs but you re likely to find yourself sitting in a corner where you can t see one and some of the park bench style seats are neither comfortable nor interestingly designed before fat heads moved in this place was a grocery store farmers market hybrid and it shows the atmosphere just can t compete with other <unk> in cleveland worth it if you re in the area at least for the beer but definitely not worth venturing out to <unk> for on its own accord
the best in charlotte consistency is key and this place executes every time been coming here for years and plan on coming here for years to come cheers
i can t even words aren t enough bad service mediocre food but the price is the same no matter what kind of experience you have i have been going to mr chows for over years from la to nyc and london and on to miami and of course vegas and i have never been so disappointed wow david is the worst captain we have ever had hate this because i used to love this place
i was in independence to meet some <unk> so i figured i d stop in for lunch after hearing my buddy tell me how good their sammiches are the line was pretty long but it seemed to move fairly quickly the lady who took my order was very nice and was efficient i had a small godfather on multigrain the bread was hearty and fresh lots of meat in the sammich and plenty of seasoning for a zesty flavor it was delicious and filling i m glad i didn t get a larger one or i would ve been on a food coma i m never out in that part of town but would go back if i was <unk> you were right
when i am starving for a burrito and at work moe s answers the call that being said i wouldn t drive out of my way to go here better than fast food moe s manages to serve up tasty burritos i do not get the naming system at all so i am always confused when trying to decide if i want a joey bag of donuts or a triple <unk> no i don t want either i want a freaking steak burrito it reminds me of the pretentious naming convention at starbucks only with an east cost feel however i usually ignore this and just tell them what to stick in my tortilla and let the cashier sort it out at the end every meal comes with chips so i was able to sample the full salsa bar it s decent if they sold jars of it i would pass but for a quick lunch fresh salsa beats taco bell any day the staff is always friendly and the line moves quick during the lunch rush which is important if your time is limited to a half an hour gets a little noisy in there sometimes but over all it s great for a slightly better than fast food lunch
although it was winter after being a tourist and walking hours from the bellagio to finally end up at the wynn it was time for an afternoon snack being in the wynn the prices for this ice cream place was little high but that was expected i wanted a pick me up so i got a scoop of homemade coffee ice cream in a sugar cone the scoop was freaking huge i think i def crashed from the sugar and caffeine high after eating my cone i wish they had kids scoops cause one scoop was too much the coffee flavor was also really strong coffee so if my <unk> was halved i prob would have been happier too
crazy weird hotdog with a potato chip crust liked the lasagna roll fun drinks fun staff giant fortune cookies
this place is my go to to satisfy my pizza craving they have regular dough which comes in a very thin crust or double dough which is still thin after its cooked and gluten free dough that comes in one size there are many different options for sauces cheeses meats and vegetables if there s a long line i would recommend grabbing a menu by the door so you can browse over the options and choose what you want i recommend going on tuesdays for custom pizzas i also recommend <unk> the pizzarev app you get a reward for signing up which is a free pizza or entree salad you will also get one point for each dollar you spend and it ll count towards another free meal
such an underrated pizza place on mill talk about the perfect slice of cheese pizza used to eat at this place every week <unk> year i ve moved onto <unk> but now that i m writing this review all the memories are flowing back we shall meet again slices
i searched on yelp for best pizza in scottsdale and this came up i thought it was great the service was wonderful the pizza was great probably thanks to the wood oven
the food is phenomenal the decorating is unique and really cool the service is snooty
excellent service delicious sushi and i like the new specials very affordable i ll definitely be crack
had the rasberry <unk> it was good but i did get very sick from it maybe bad <unk> everyone else has something else and were fine we waited mins for a table out side very close seating and very loud service was good and friendly don t think we will go back expensive for what we got
ew don t go here i like found like a weird like bug in my chicken i thought it was just a big piece of pepper btw it wasn t i used to love mcdonald s but now i only go every day instead of twice a day because of this mishap i also found out that their chicken is fake that <unk> fake like me
we ve only been here for breakfast and brunch and it s what you would expect it wasn t bad but nothing outstanding either the pools are nice and so is the scenery
<unk> <unk> belle sortie <unk> les <unk> sont plus <unk> commande via une <unk>
delicious italian food with owners that go out of their way to make you feel welcome we loved everything we had
small quaint corner restaurant with a lot of charm small counter space with a few tables do not discourage the wait for home style food breakfast and brunch are cash only but so what it s worth it assortment of egg dishes and various pancakes with a nice raspberry ice tea are a highlight the brunch menu offered their own specialties but we were only two people so we didn t sample them attentive friendly wait staff made sure your cup is always filled quirky fun decor not good for large groups points for anyone who can identify the error with the new york mirror scene check out the local antique stores for some <unk>
good bread crusty on the outside soft inside plenty of meat original dave s and lettuce dave s sauce a little overwhelming and the packing is less than ideal the meat all ends up folded into a u on the outer edge the lettuce sauce piled up inside i prefer to get a mix of both in each bite wish they d have sides all i could see were chips
i feel like the other reviews are a bit unfair so far especially as it seems most of them went during the first weeks the place was open usually not a good time to judge the quality of a new restaurant personally with the limited selection of tap beers in the town this place is a gift tons of micro brews and local suds some that i haven t even heard of like piano music playing classic hits was nice not crazy loud service was just fine very friendly we ordered a salad with chicken way too much stuff in the salad and the fried mushrooms surprisingly delicious overall suggest if you are looking for a place with a wide selection of craft local brews on tap this place doesn t disappoint
okay sammy we need to talk about your place the food was okay and the service well the service was below par to be kind let me explain we walked in around noon and could count all of the people in the restaurant on one hand and since the weather was awesome today mid s and a slight breeze we opted to sit outside and enjoy our lunch and the weather alike the server sat us and was kind enough to let us know that if we decided to order pizza s it would be a little longer then normal because they just opened and the oven was not up to temp yet that is totally understandable and i appreciate the warning so we sat outside and decided on our order closed the menus finished our waters and continued to sit so about minutes later the waiter came out and asked if we had decided since we had plenty of time of coarse we said yes we ordered a prosciutto asparagus pizza a kids bbq chicken pizza and i ordered a grilled chicken breast and hummus sandwich after another to minute wait we received our food the sandwich i ordered was amazing and so were the other items we ordered but the lack of service and the constant empty drinks unfortunately were to much to overlook the three stars are for the food being good and obviously the docked stars are for the service or lack there of if you have the hankering for sammys i would recommend the w sahara store over this one
one of the finest hotels ever we stayed in the venezia tower some added <unk> and <unk> in our square foot room larger than out sf apartment rooms are well appointed with luxurious beds <unk> lovely and expensive furnishings and a bathroom to die for <unk> soaking tub and seperate glass enclosed shower with multiple shower heads service is <unk> complaint is registration despite the private check in advertised in the <unk> tower we waited almost min for one of only two employees to help us this was the thur before memorial weekend more than employees please folks not the <unk> of patrons we figured out a way to go for less than premium cost each suite offer two large queen beds and a double size couch pull out double <unk> runs about night five people fit extremely comfortably into these rooms we pulled off the venetian for about per person total for all nights
i would recommend the breakfast bagel a cute little cafe with real coffee and freshly prepared sandwiches definitely would not have found this place if it wasn t for yelp cos it is not a tourist hot spot at all thanks guys go through the mall complex and the entrance to the cafe is from the inside of the bigger building it s housed in
i have been coming in here for many years now what is not to love i think the food is pretty fantastic pizza really good wings excellant salads are <unk> and flavorful like how easy it is to call in an order pick it up at the window and go good staff the decor is a bit old fashion in an s way but in the grand scheme it means nothing i like the food here so i will be back many times lots of parking in the lot as well
if it had just been based on the burgers i d have given it star i m sorry but i don t like a bun dominant burger and these buns are dry tasteless and overwhelm the burger so yes i got rid of the bun and tried to eat the rest but i did not expect nor appreciate that hidden spice in my veggie burger and definitely did not like the chipotle in the bbq sauce of my husband s bbq burger not everyone likes spice so i d have liked the option of sweet bbq sauce instead ended up with a root beer float okay but the soda machine got stuck and sprayed me an my son not cool and fries <unk> from everyone else s plate fries were good just the right amount of crispiness not too skinny not too <unk> you put your own amount of salt on them my son didn t like the dark deep fried breading panko of his kids menu chicken fingers so i ate them very fresh good for me bad for him my other son did not finish his kid s cheeseburger so that s a bad sign he always finishes his burger the staff was friendly and management was very gracious for taking the uneaten veggie burger off the bill but it was still too expensive and not a good enough first time experience to return sorry
<unk> closed that would have been so wrong but just moved to a new location wish i had checked their web site before going to the old location which is now deserted i feel like such an idiot for not doing my homework ditto on other reviews best bagels in town yes better than s and definitely better than s
good hotdogs and vegan options it s so packed you d think there were no other places around to eat if you re over or over huge crowds you probably won t care too much for the happy dog atmosphere it s more like college kids being overly excited that there s something good they can afford instead of ramen all the time
no pets allowed on the patio per owner s request not code my salad was filling and good and my hubby ate all his fish sandwich i would reccomend this place
fantastic pizza ideas i highly recommend the roman or the cheeseburger pizza chicken quesadilla is great as are the wings fish fry basket is decent
came in at after a <unk> concert at the <unk> we sat down as did several other people coming from the concert it was last call for food our waitress informed us so we were really rushed in giving our order we ended up with the mac n cheese bites app black forest sandwich to split they have a large selection of beer however we were so rushed we didn t get to thoroughly look it over thus just ordered something that quickly jumped out at us my husband was <unk> of his choice after he had more time to look it over b c there were so many other good options the food came out fast it was typical bar food but the fries were really bad in general it s not somewhere we would purposely choose to go but sufficed as an option in our situation it s not a dive bar but it s not nice at all which makes it surprising that it has so many beer options only awesome thing was that a fellow concert goer pumped the <unk> box full of <unk> songs to keep it going after such an awesome show
super excited that we tried this place out my stomach is very happy we used the free order crab puff for a check in and we will definitely order them next time we go the sweet and sour chicken was not breaded too much like most places this is definitely our new chinese place
food stars customer service or stars the food is amazing i ve tried the chicken waffles vegan tacos french fries caramel salted cupcake rocky road brownie lemon bar and biscuits gravy the last one wasn t as amazing as the rest the gravy was a bit bland runny and the biscuit was flat and not fluffy everything else i mentioned though so dang good service though sucks there s one lady there black short hair bangs glasses that has taken our order a couple times and she never says anything never smiles never greets anyone at the register never does anything but reads off the total it s very off putting and uncomfortable especially when this happened our very first visit the only reason we go back is the food
the taste is not too bad but the amount of meat is so small <unk> high <unk> and thickness of meat is so thin layered i will not go this restaurant again
don t get the sushi it was disgusting honestly i d like my money back it s basically a giant rice ball with questionable fish ah tuna isn t supposed to be this color that overwhelming taste of the cheap sea weed wrapper ugh
i love the name but that s about it the food was lacking and the desserts look better than it tastes
from the perspective of a <unk> conference <unk> who <unk> in some gambling but is here because she has to be and is intending on enjoying a pampered mini vacation the good the entry level room was a <unk> sq feet there were nice <unk> controlled shades the <unk> living room was kind of cool and the marble counter top lighting was pretty the bathroom could have used a <unk> tub but it was huge and nicely appointed also they gave out nice coupons for slot credit if you have their club grazie card and i managed to turn my coupon into a modest profit everything else sucked their service is the stuff of <unk> i booked three nights using <unk> a <unk> of <unk> that our firm uses to book all our corporate travel the venetian <unk> believed i had booked only two nights when i called <unk> and had them fax the venetian people a receipt clearly stating i had booked and prepaid for three nights they still didn t get the message i talked to at least three <unk> the front desk the reservations manager and a group reservations department who all seemed <unk> if they would talk to each other or check their fax machines once in a while maybe they wouldn t be so confused but after two phone calls at the hotel one very frustrating conversation at the front desk and yet one more phone call from home i m still waiting for them to do research they promised to call me back but after their embarrassing show of incompetence the first oh four or five times that i explained this problem to them i m sort of doubtful and i m getting ready to just dispute the charge straight through my chase credit card especially noteworthy the front desk <unk> had awful attitude and were condescending and impatient they made it seem like my fault that this problem had occurred and were <unk> that it was my mistake they treated me like i didn t know what i was talking about and was there just to make trouble even though i have already wasted hours of my life that i will never get back trying to resolve this no one there seemed to know what <unk> was hello <unk> is a fairly common place corporate booking service i ve used them for a while and they are quite on the top of their game i am convinced that the problem is on the venetian s end not <unk> s end if the venetian wants their bread and butter which is <unk> to still appear on their <unk> every now and then they better get it together my colleague who was also there for a conference also got charged an extra night so clearly they ve got some sort of data input problem going on what s up with the <unk> <unk> smell that s overwhelming the air everywhere i smell it immediately when i enter and am reminded of a public toilet not good for the classy image they re trying to sell finally for the love of god they need to play something other than sound clips from their phantom of the opera show in the elevator i love love love this musical having seen it both in new york and in cleveland but if i have to hear their mediocre rendition of music of the night one more time i m going to lose it bottom line stay away there are plenty of other similarly priced and better run options on the strip and if you want a truly relaxing experience try something off strip that s non gaming like the trump or the platinum at least there you won t be run over by all the inebriated slot machine zombies or be forced to inhale days old second hand smoke
my family and i moved out here from southern california recently and have been trying to find a good mexican restaurant so far nothing has blown us away until now service food drinks are all top notch at juan s from the salsa bean dip and fried onions jalape os they bring before the meal to the great enchiladas juan s is hands down the best mexican food in vegas
have been here twice and that s it really expensive for the food you get and it s so not worth it paid almost for a quesadilla that i could ve made at home for at least half the price the brisket was amazing and the only reason this place is getting two stars beware
great idea for a driving range however we chose to go on a friday night it was a madhouse i don t recommend doing this they assured us of a hr wait so we waited and after that hour we were still th in line for a bay and we re told it would be another hour and min if you want to practice your swing don t go to top golf if you want to drink and fry a friday night waiting and drinking with the possibility of hitting a few balls this is the place for you
came here for breakfast today with a friend and our kids she has been to other locations and has had excellent customer service this location however has horrible service and we waited way too long for our food plus when the food came the croissants came out last and were not heated when we asked to have them heated the girl asked us to hold on after waiting forever another few minutes was not possible once we were done the server cashier came back around and asked if we got our heated croissants as she was the only one who knew we asked for them to be heated of course we did not get them heated i would not return to this location as the service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best the shop inside is cute and i would consider trying a different location for their lunch as far as any highlights of this location i will say that it is clean and quiet
i honestly had to write this review this place totally deserves it first of all the food was amazing customer service is the best i came earlier today with my girlfriend and had forgot my ring in the ladies room the girl <unk> went and searched for it times till she found it and kept it for me ring wasn t valuable but was an important souvenir anyways i got here and they welcomed me again and gave me these corona rings and sunglasses and they were very extremely friendly this is the new spot for me thank you very much
reliably great food and service always kept nice and clean good place to bring your laptop and do some work while enjoying a bite to eat tasty sandwiches and pasta dishes as well as a wide variety of sweet treats usually never crowded or loud convenient location in pv scottsdale
love this deli and it s walking distance from my place lucky me they serve a great breakfast and lunch with all the traditional classics you d expect from a ny style deli
used to love this place but lately they ve been <unk> out on their promotions and sizes of their wontons and fish balls this kind of <unk> me because jim chai kee is supposed to be a famous place that does have a lot of regulars eating there by doing this it does not only show how cheap the owner is but how much they don t appreciate their clients especially the regulars
food is good their brewed beer is not great service is awful been here about times within the last months we just moved here food good burgers and sandwiches great appetizers especially the cheese curds and <unk> drinks their own beer is only okay but they carry a wide selection of others including many craft beers and a full bar atmosphere wonderful it s a beautiful restaurant great outdoor dining really nice bar area and an upstairs for private parties and whatnot service this is their big problem i can only really speak for the bartender and bar servers but we have had bad experiences on almost all occasions i won t go into details but you aren t greeted timely drinks go empty and they aren t friendly by any means the only good service was when we dined on the patio but we could see the bartender and servers eating food behind the bar through the window ugh all in all if it wasn t for the poor service and waitstaff we would be here often but i m contemplating even going again
very convenient location for me since i live near here and i must say their food is really good price is reasonable and affordable
xiao long bao everything else it was greasy and bland for the price of everything totally not worth it unless you re just coming for xlb s
it s a tad hard to describe the food here since i don t really understand the language but my friend tried this place loved it and took us here we started with the wrapping your own rice paper rolls with beef cooked in a hot broth then with sausages the giant <unk> with shrimp chips was probably my favourite there was also pho and beef congee and <unk> fried dice beef was that dishes of beef yet the food was great though and i wish i was more hungry and didnt have so much beef on the days before hand service was okay and the place was extremely quiet i would have thought this place would attract more customers
i guess if you are looking for a halal pizza with a pakistani twist it ain t bad then again there aren t many halal pizza options near <unk> anyway we had a guest who only eats halal so we gave this place a shot prices are very reasonable i got two large pizzas with toppings for that s a good deal plus they don t charge extra for the dipping sauce
went out to eat for breakfast with a friend yesterday ordered the santa fe <unk> s the blend of chicken and veggies was perfectly spiced liked the green tea i ordered as well it was my first time and i will definitely be back for more
nice atmosphere very friendly staff nice pace and the food was very good chicken brie and fig sandwich tasty sticky toffee chocolate pudding was divine good choice to come in here
<unk> fine foods is an excellent source for your vegan whole foods i was shocked that it wasn t near as expensive as everyone said on par with whole foods
having a <unk> lunch with my better half didn t care for this dim sum place but we know what was good and not good from our first visit so we ordered chinese brocolli beef tendons x fried taro and salt and pepper shrimp that hit the spot and literally ate everything again nice staff very attentive happy eats
this was my first visit to top golf and i honestly felt it was just ok i took my party of seven there during our vacation in the valley the kids really enjoyed it the four adults were less than overwhelmed the food was so so and we all thought the golf prices were a bit high all in all just a so so experience
i have never see any restaurant can do like this they help me write done the tips thx god
as a non hot dog person i was not super excited to see the menu however i ordered the vodka slaw and three hot sauces and it was so flavorful i got over the fact that i was eating <unk> animals scraps in the shape of a tube the tots at first struck me as meh as in not <unk> tots however the sauces i ordered again brought them to a new level of yummy i got the momocho piri piri thai chili and <unk> ketchup not sure what was what because none of the sauces looked like any of the restaurant or jar versions i ve tried before so i just kind of mixed and went with the combined flavor which was spicy and garlicky and yummy the only reason for the three rating is that i would have loved some wings or another food option and the ability to rate vs or forced choice is not the friend of business establishments in a nutshell a definite must try at least once when you decide to cast your health and <unk> concerns to the winds and dive in
my daughter and i visited the snow rd parma oh location at approximately am on saturday we frequent this location a couple times a month and usually have no issues until this visit we walked in and stood at the counter waiting for an employee to greet us after about minutes someone in the kitchen said someone will be with you paige came out she looked like she was either throwing up or had <unk> and shouldn t be working she was unable to concentrate my daughter asked for an iced coffee the container was not dated a food safety violation btw the other employee said it was days old we got regular coffee our food was cold i used <unk> after we sat as i did not want to get whatever paige had other customers came in and left as she was not paying any attention to them it was not good she should have called off i wrote to burger king and have gotten no response hmmm
i m happy to say that after years and a change of ownership management my family and i have returned to hogtown vegan the new owners are much much more considerate thoughtful and responsive than the previous owners the new location is cleaner bigger and much more efficiently organized the menu is stronger than it was a few years ago and the kitchen is much more consistent service has been great too we re glad to have hogtown back in the rotation if you had a bad experience in the past we suggest that you give it another shot under the new management
i was hungry for some authentic asian food while staying at the very expensive venetian hotel it s hard to find good asian food at an high end hotel but this place here is pretty good and authentic i ordered the bbq pork and chow mein it was good and big portions too i will come again
i am a fanatic for thai food and this one is definitely on the list being vegetarian makes it hard to eat at most places but this thai place does accomodate to everyone the noodles rice stir fry dishes are delish i don t eat sushi but my sister devoured the veg sushi she got because it was that good they have a good selection of food drinks sushi its a place to try if you love thai food or feeling adventurous
the food is incredible the coffee is wonderful and the hospitality is better still
one of the worst buying experiences since moving to cleveland my son called and ordered a large pie for <unk> it arrived i was taken aback by how small it was like one of those mini pizzas you get in the supermarket the delivery guy just shrugged like he d heard it all before i called and the girl who answered could care less about my concern and said that was their large for a mini pizza i mean really i called back and the manager said the same could care less i was cool and calm when i spoke with them but they treated me like a complaining person will never order from them again
it was our first time in warm welcome we sat at bar and bartender was very pleasant we ordered the deviled eggs then we had the grilled corn on the cob yummy then we split the cheeseburger which was very juicy and tasty but to my <unk> should not be rated as best burger in az it was all very good we had the coconut pie for dessert also very good although not excellent overall very pleasant time nice little place good music although it kept playing the same songs over and over again will come back for sure thank you
this is a nice intimate chinese restaurant that s located inside the hard rock casino the food here was very tasty and on point with authentic chinese cuisine i especially liked the vegetable lo mein it was flavorful with crisp vegetables and perfectly cooked noodles also the potstickers and crab rangoon s were an excellent choice for appetizers the service was quick and friendly i did also try the kung pao chicken i would say this was not one of my favorites as it was not very spicy at all the general s chicken was a much better choice overall a good meal experience
quick pick up of salad and smoothies can t ask for a better fast food option i tried every smoothie every one was very good we also had the cobb salad very good too we will definitely be returning
not too bad sort of like a chipotle but for bbq food is very good service was a tad slow prices are a tad high had the salad with chicken on top pretty good but they didn t seem to know what to put on it besides lettuce and chicken soft drink prices are insane and rc no pepsi no coke i ll pass at least they gave me a full size cup for water atmosphere is decent i ll be back stars
i came with a group of friends from out of town we went to the bar twice once for happy hour and once on our last night in town they had a great karaoke set up and great drinks we all had a great time and danced the night away they also had an arcade we didn t play any of the games but it was cool to see in a bar
it s so disappointing every single time i try and eat here because i legitimately like the food however a restaurant like this shouldn t require reservations but in order to get your food in a timely manner that s almost what it needs i m not too sure what the issue is because i ve seen busier restaurants and i ve never had to wait so long i ve complained before regarding the long wait and they told me if i want to be able to get my food in a timely manner then i should call my food in ahead of time well i ve tried three times on one occasion they put me on hold for ten minutes which i wasn t upset about then someone picked up the phone and said oh someone s on a call and they were <unk> around to find out who s on call with me until the finally said hello and ended up hanging up on me second time i tried calling they said they couldn t hear me and hung up on me and when i tried calling back it was busy for minutes third time which is the last time i tried calling no one ever picked up either i was getting hung up on multiple times or they were ignoring my calls which i tried calling from didn t numbers thinking it might have been my service at some point the poor service starts to outweigh the food i will honestly never come here again
the food is remarkably fresh healthy and unique order a salad i m a sucker for the coffee and the workers too they re super friendly and accommodating
for an egg sandwich place you get what you wait for the sausage egg cheese sandwich is pretty filling and juicy but if i had to wait hours to get one like at the <unk> location i would definitely pass fortunately the vegas location the wait isnt that long i arrived at am on friday and was out of there by am
i visited happy dog with my father for father s day the tater tots are to die for and the restaurant has all kinds of cool toppings for hot dogs the restaurant also has some cool local bands play every once in a while would definitely recommend checking it out if you re in the area
meant to go here last time but ended up next door so i tried this place a week ago shouldn t have bothered everything was squished into a small chinese take out box when i peaked in the bag before leaving i thought they had left something out but was assured everything was there uh yea everything was so tightly squished that it was too much effort just trying to peel the noodles away from everything else and you can imagine the portion of ingredients if it all fit into that container when i got home i couldn t find the meat and was so disgusted and irritated when i noticed the few pieces i was given had been <unk> floating in the hot liquid since i left the establishment needless to say the meat had overcooked in the broth and was nothing more than thin strips of leather when i called and inquired why the items weren t put on the side for a take out order like most normal vietnamese places do for pho i only received a response was that i needed to ask amount of meat given was so not worth the barely two decent sized servings also what viet restaurant doesn t have the spicy peppered flakes oil sauce apparently they don t i asked for extra and got some nasty mix that just ended up in the <unk> was good but not good enough to go back
the hotel is beautiful this review is for the lost and found department im just really upset at them i forgot a book in the nightstand drawer i called the lost and found they didn t even call back so i called them again hours later they said that they did check and didn t find it witch makes no sense at all because i know for sure it was there
urban rice has a grand opening in chinatown it s now located in the first location which housed the first double greetings if you know where five harvest plaza that s where the restaurant is it has a dim sum special priced at and a lunch special noodles priced at there s also a poster advertising their chinese dinner specials we had their dim sum <unk> morning a little slow in their service but good dim sum nonetheless you order off their paper menu written in chinese and english
the salmon special is out of the this world and the black rice gives harumi a distinct advantage when comparing sushi spots around town i give harumi a must eat rating
bar burrito serves reasonable burritos and tacos at reasonable prices we ordered one order of fish taco order has tacos for and an order of chicken burrito for the fish was battered and it was fresh and crunchy it tasted okay and was not excessively chewy we asked for mild hotness with hot sauce on the side the chipotle hot sauce was hot the chicken burrito had a good balance of bean rice and green unlike some mexican fast food places that stuff <unk> amount of rice in a burrito it made a more enjoyable texture to chew through there was not too much meat it was mixed with the beans but it was there the key good point was the reasonable prices the fish tacos were good for a light lunch and the burrito was a satisfying lunch i wouldn t mind returning for some mexican fast food
absolutely delicious and extremely unique had to wait in line for about ish minutes but it was well worth it i got the slut and it was fabulous so much flavor
great place sometimes think they need more seating and some healthier options hence the missing star they are the only ones with spinach knish not just potato the matzah ball soup is great and fresh bagels are great best place for brunch meals to go too bad it isn t more convenient for me
the food is fantastic i pretty much always get whatever the special is i think the sandwiches are honestly a little better than their stir fry stuff but this does not detract from how awesome the place is go for the spicy g if you want a spicy faux chicken thing or the argentine poboy for a delicious sweet <unk> type meat sandwich it is a little pricey sometimes but you are paying for specialty foods their vegan veggie market in the store is convenient if you want to try something out but it s really marked up in comparison to buying almost any of these things from the internet not even in bulk
i have been here several times and it definitely isn t a place i would recommend every time i decide to give it another <unk> end up not wanting to come back their soon tofu was bland the first and second time i tried it and during the most recent visit it was too salty for my liking this recent time that i went my friend s bulgogi soup came first and for some reason my other friend and i s combination soon tofu was no where in sight we had our rice scooped and ready in front of us but it took a good mins for our outstanding tofu soups to come out by that time the bulgogi soup was not boiling hot anymore while our tofu soups <unk> d say it defeats the purpose of coming to this place since people come and expect a boiling hot pot the side dishes are good but i have had better around the area i even tried this place in markham and it was <unk> spectacular there is better <unk> jjigae out there
very disappointed eating here after all the great reviews we had a shrimp nachos dish which was huge but was very bland had no flavor most of the cheese was not even melted we also had a southwestern chicken taco salad which had a bad flavor and did not taste fresh this was the worst mexican food we ever had beware
they leave the roll up door between the bar and the smoking patio wide open so you can enjoy the cigarette smoke while you eat
absolutely loved their prime rib it was perfect every bite was delicious i ve been to the one in toronto and this one is just as good try their pineapple splash you won t regret it
the scene an intimate course chef s tasting menu at heritage food drink a long table full of my yelp friends sparkling glasses of water craft beer and wine on a crisp white table cloth the interior of the restaurant is warm understated and cozy the courses deviled egg with pimento cheese tempura whole baby turnips with sweet chili sauce beet tartar with beet sponge cake florida shrimp with black rice baby bok choy and shitake mushrooms gulf oyster with black eyed peas ham and hot sauce duck breast with <unk> puree brussel sprouts and fig glaze dessert courses chocolate mousse hybrid with powdered peanut butter chocolate explosion truffle layered with powdered <unk> every course was delicious well thought out and executed the plating was the really exciting part each dish was like a beautiful painting the tempura seafood and dessert courses especially stood out for me our servers incredible genuine knowledgeable highly attentive friendly the sheer number of plates and silverware they turned over was impressive the ingredients locally sourced seasonal <unk> in both a functional dish <unk> way while simultaneously highlighting each ingredient s flavor the results are complex <unk> dishes the chef chef paul is just plain great he is passionate about his ingredients and <unk> them in distinct ways a real artist with some amazing molecular gastronomy techniques the finale smiles all around warm hugs <unk> and <unk> the summary worth the trip to waxhaw the real deal five star food and service experience it for yourself
banh mi vietnamese subs are not the norm around my side of town but since this is near school and doesn t require a detour from my normal routes it hits the spot was craving a bbq pork sandwich loaded with vegetables including cucumbers carrots and the white one which is so honestly called white carrot when translated my way and cilantro delicious friendly staff and the bread comes out warm possibly due to heating in a conventional oven before the goodies are inserted but still nonetheless satisfying i prefer this style of banh mi versus the lee s baguettes or any baguettes for that matter since they re much tougher and tend to <unk> the top of my mouth definitely recommended but will have to try other dishes when i am inclined to do so
me and my boyfriend always come and get the same thing all the time a pepperoni pizza because its so good but today we wanted to try something new i got a hamburger and it was delicious he got a double bacon cheeseburger which he said was the best burgers he s ever ate along with fries fries were amazing crisp and seasoned just right
great way to start the day in vegas i had never been to a vegas pool party and this was the perfect first experience if you want to get up close to the djs pool parties are the way to go as the majority of the people there are in the pool and the dance floor isn t crowded at all since i went with some girlfriends we had free entry and two free drink tickets which were for champagne we saw rl grime who was great best to get there early before people start <unk> puking and spilling their drinks in the pool haha <unk> are but you can open it as many times as you want throughout the day
excellent place quick trendy and awesome menu the decor is cool look at the <unk> or the <unk> i d give them stars if they add halal food to their menu
jacky chan i will definitely start by saying this is not in the slightest as great as the real jacky chan he would probably be insulted if he found out a place like this named <unk> after him this is my first time trying this place with my husband i got the orange chicken with wonton soup and he got chicken curry the flavor was not there for almost anything sadly the rice was the best part of the whole meal we decided to order thai tea boba since we love boba and we love thai tea the boba itself was made well however the thai tea part was very watery yuck to top it off we spent about and asked to use a coupon for free rangoons with purchase of over and were told no that it s for take out only sad we may come back one day but for now it s not looking likely i would probably give a solid stars but will give for price and the fact that the food was okay not good but could do better
i just ordered online from this location and it said to be there at so i was there at that time but my order was not ready the staff member making the sandwiches also was the assistant manager and he said that he only knew part of the order because the receipt tape ran out of the printer and he didn t get the details of the rest of the sandwich order had i not known what my coworker had ordered i would have had to drive back to work ask her what was on her sandwich and then drive back to subway because i had already paid for these two sandwiches which subway had taken my money out of my account but didn t make the sandwiches because of a printing issue at the franchise restaurant luckily i have an excellent memory and i remembered exactly how she wanted her tuna wrap i asked the <unk> manager if i couldn t remember would he have <unk> my money for the one sandwich and he said corporate would have to refund me because i ordered online it s ridiculous that a problem created at the franchise level is rectified days later by corporate we finally got our wraps thanks to me not subway and i will not be ordering via online or maybe ever from this location because my time is important but subway doesn t think so
i ve been coming here for a few years but won t be any more the food and service only gets worse i ve had servers spill things on me and not even apologize most of the food is pre cooked or made it s basically the taco bell equivalent of thai food you re better off making it yourself and even if you were willing to stay for the mediocre food because it might be easier than cooking at home the staff and service aren t worth it they re rude not accommodating and good luck getting their attention
different taste of the one in pacific mall less noodles inside need to improve don t want to go there any more
heavy on the atmosphere heavy on the red sauce light on the wallet no the food here isn t great but it s good and i always make time to come here every time i come to vegas it s worth it just to see the piano bar recommendations chicken parm not veal for some reason meatballs gnocchi also they have a private dining room in which i ve had several successful events and make for a nice break from the typical trade show stuff and definitely gets people to remember you
two of us dining with a bottle of wine spent one appetizer with mozzarella with peppers we didn t like it two entries and there u go before tip my fianc wanted to substitute sauce and there was a charge the bread was good and we ate all of it because of the long wait between appetizers and our entrees when we got our meal we asked for more bread and they said there would be another charge most of the time italian restaurants pride themselves on their guests leaving full i had the lobster raviolis and there was four of them in a bowl for we left very disappointed the food itself was satisfactory but the price and the atmosphere wasn t
have not had the pleasure of checking out their store but i did hit up the food truck when they visited asu awesome key lime the graham crust was amazing buttery and delicious the crust on the chocolate pie was good too and i don t usually care for standard pie crust the mini pies could feed two people but we destroyed one full dessert each posting a <unk> on their website that shows dates and locations for the food truck was a brilliant move everyone in my office is excited that they come to tempe once a week one suggestion the website does not appear to list business hours for the phoenix pie shop
love this place for lunch typical chinese fast food take out at a reasonable cost a regular here for years
any sushi restaurant that is taking pride in offering farm raised fish is a sushi restaurant you stay away from period food was just okay and service was ridiculous because they have young teenagers serving you and they have no clue about sushi eat at your own risk
lots of great vegetarian options here the brussels sprouts on the stalk were crisped and covered in a delicious aioli the flatbread with eggplant and feta spread was outstanding the servings are huge so pace yourself the staff was extremely friendly
we visit senor taco s fairly regularly as the service food appearance and employees have always made it an enjoyable visit this last sunday nite around was a clear exception on staffing and cleanliness the place was not busy when we arrived or left although there were several empty tables none of them were cleaned we chose the least dirty table and asked the cashier waitress if she could wipe it down for us she did so but so poorly we went over and picked up some napkins and put water on them and wiped the table ourselves i went up to order and stood directly in front of the cashier our faces were about inches apart she was staring at the wall mounted tv where some sort of hispanic dance show was on i stared directly at her face but she did not break eye contact with the tv until i turned around to look at the tv to see what was so mesmerizing she took our order at that point and then just stood around doing basically nothing the condiment area was in need of restocking there was not a clean table anywhere and food remnants and or used plates etc remained on all tables used napkins and crumbs <unk> the floor we were their about minutes or so no one ever cleaned a table the floor or acknowledged us when we left clearly not a good visit we have always liked senor taco s but this visit left us thinking it is time to look elsewhere for a more organized eatery
my family loves this restaurant we all have varied tastes and enjoy exploring the entire menu my favorite is eggplant and shrimp with schezuan sauce the staff is friendly and efficient much better than the current restaurant trend of <unk> attention highly recommend
i must really love this place because i ve been here twice in days i came in today got the honor of meeting vinny the manager he s such an awesome guy gave me another great deal on a pizza i already have a pizza obsession i m glad payless pizza has the goods to feed my addiction
came here on a sunday evening it s not busy at all staff did not greet upon entering they were chit chatting finally one decided to come up and sit us down we weren t served water until we asked for it that s after we were half way done with our dessert the ice cream they served was like shaved ice texture it was frozen and flaky how could you serve that and call it ice cream if i wanted shaved ice i have better places to go to usually this place brings smiles to the patrons but today i felt they let us down big time up your game staff at this location
i won t get into all the details how we ended up finding this place and how we were craving an italian hot table for lunch let me tell you this was the worst italian hot table food that i have ever eaten i had the bow tie penne ala vodka which had absolutely no flavour hardly any sauce honestly i ate it because i was hungry but did not enjoy any of it the food did not remember italian or any or ethnicity does the person who made this even know how to cook don t let me get started on my husbands panini which was equally as bad don t you take pride in serving good food
pizza rev was amazing when i went there the other week i love how you can add any toppings and a personal sized pizza with a drink for a very reasonable price this was my first time there but i will most definitely be back soon
place was empty when my friend and i came in the sushi was just ok every time i d pick you a sushi with my chopsticks the sushi fell apart we ended up using our fingers to hold the sushi together we had no plates it was pretty sucky
this place has one of the best baked pork chop rice i m gta and it s really the only hk style restaurant in downtown toronto good service and good value
great atmosphere great service amazing food delicious drinks whats not to like here its on the expensive side but you really get your money s worth in both quality and quantity a balance that can be so hard to find in vegas the menu changes often depending on whats in season but that s what makes every dish special here i can t wait to return maybe next time i ll enjoy an evening of wine with there house made cheese and cured meat while sitting outside on there beautiful patio
<unk> i came here because it s guy fieri i admit it i ve seen his food on tv and it looks good pics on yelp looked good arrived early for breakfast place had cool decor staff was friendly felt comfortable immediately i ordered the steak <unk> and my mom the chorizo burrito she tried ordering a hot chocolate they don t have it on menu fine no biggie a little odd but we ordered something else food came out promptly and it looked amazing unfortunately and extremely disappointing the food was bland how can something that looks sooo good and has so many ingredients lack so much flavor moms burrito lacked something as <unk> bummer nothing against the staff they were great but i wouldn t be back or give my recommendation if the food s no good what s the point
just got a slice today and it was very good the service was fast but the price was a bit higher than i m used to i will return again if i m in the area
great pizza and very friendly service we have been getting pizza and calzones from <unk> for years and have never been disappointed the small made to order calzone is two meals for me and awesome when i reheat in the oven pasta is above average and marinara is good salads could use some improving but i am very picky about good salads overall great local place
i m from minnesota and was thrilled to see a caribou since i just moved here vanilla white mochas are a taste of home love this place and glad to see it just find it strange it closes at pm on weekends
i went here with a group for lunch today to check out their winterlicious menu i loved the atmosphere in the restaurant it was very clean and nicely decorated it s mardi gras without most of the tacky overly stereotypical elements that i ve seen in similar restaurants which makes it seem more classy in my opinion i ordered the popcorn shrimp for my appetizer which came with a tomato pepper sauce i liked the shrimp but felt that the sauce was not well suited to the dish the main course i ordered was jambalaya and for days before this lunch i was looking forward to the kick of spice that i ve found in every jambalaya that i ve had when i received the dish i was seriously disappointed to find that it had very little spice seasoning at all i am not a spice fanatic by any stretch so it is significant when i consider a dish to be too bland for dessert i ordered the apple crumble it was okay but not memorable some of my dining companions ordered the pulled pork and not one of them finished it they said the sauce was way too sweet the bun was too large and the meat was just okay i feel like this restaurant doesn t live up to its potential at all the staff is friendly the location is great and the atmosphere is lovely the problem is their food which for a restaurant is a pretty big problem
the waitresses have been super friendly but the bartender britney needs to be fired she yells at customers and takes any request as an inconvenience customer service is not in her wheel house trying to get a change of channel is like parting the red sea please help
we liked this place when it was <unk> <unk> <unk> now that another irish bar has moved in we thought we would check it out if you haven t seen it i m pretty sure nothing else but am irish bar could move in they changed very little of the decor except for hanging some kennedy pictures on the wall the menu is more expensive and upscale but the food did not live up to the descriptions the chips were dry and tasteless and there was one small piece of fish for bucks my roasted beet salad had like beets i had added shrimp to it and they just threw cold unseasoned shrimp on top the dressing was non descript i ve picked up better salads from trader joes honestly it was not worth the money at all we decided we would come for a beer but eat somewhere else another mediocre restaurant opens on the west side sigh
i love smoke s poutine but do not visit this location terrible customer service and they did not honour the coupon that was given out by smoke s <unk> the poutine itself had hardly any curds compared to what i have gotten at other locations really disappointing
i wish i can give negative star the worst service worst pizza and at the end they argued i walked into get pizza ordered a thin crust cheese pizza they told me its going to be to mins after mins of waiting i get my pizza in thick crust and cheese was not even spread evenly pizza crust seemed half uncooked similar experience happened multiple times with this location
stars it s not the best chinese food but it s not bad for vegas conveniently located in the venetian my dad had a couple meals here b c he didnt want to venture outside the hotel the food is decent especially the soup noodles stay away from the <unk> pork and the hot and sour soup
not for anyone in a hurry the bagel bin is very popular and always has a line so save it for a lazy saturday morning the bagels are great and very fresh with a great deal of choices they have fresh lox and other types of meat if you want a little protein with your bagel the only thing i do not like about the bagel bin is their coffee its disgusting i have to have my coffee in the morning so i would suggest hitting up the starbucks and then going to get your bagel great place for the bagel lover
from the greeting of the hostess out front to the friendly staff inside it was a great experience i really wasn t expecting much as it was a very young crowd both the staff and clientele and it was rather busy for a sunday eve after pm they were great every one of them i had the bombay chicken curry dish and my hubby had the <unk> something pasta both dishes were tasty and plentiful would definitely recommend
i do love a good dog yep i ll say i m a fan of jj s the char heel is my go to dog but i like their coney dog too they ve got good selection of beers as well as fountain drinks most of the time i ll get mine to go but the seating inside is nice i still haven t been to the roof top dining area need to try that in the spring could be a good place for some after work drinks or maybe some even some day drinking ha
i hate to do this i m downgrading to stars i still really like this place but the service has slowed down somewhat still a great deal for downtown ayce and still way way better than the woo s that used to <unk> the space great menu plenty of selection and pretty solid quality certainly better than i d expect from a downtown toronto ayce place at including soup salad and dessert the lunch special is a particular treat come early for the patio which is fairly quiet and absolutely perfect for summertime there s also an ayce lunch for that i tried today very nice menu selection though it d be nice to have an option to pay a bit extra for sashimi dinner is something like for a solid ayce menu the seafood fried rice is to die for the sashimi is fresh and they ve even got some innovative rolls their signature spring sushi roll was particularly good and a fair selection of thai food which is all quite tasty grabbing a sapporo on the patio is a fabulous thing in the summertime too all that being said for its value solid menu and great service with a few very rare slips this place still gets a strong recommendation as my top choice ayce sushi in downtown toronto
amazing sushi place took my son who was just finishing basic training for dinner we are from vancouver and has no idea what to expect as our expectations for good sushi is pretty high excellent food we shared a variety of rolls some sashimi as well as a beef teriyaki all was very good and the staff was very friendly and helpful none of speak french and our waiter not only got all our order correct i have some food allergies and he went out of his way to make sure the food my son and mom ordered with my allergy was completely separate from the other food if you are looking for sushi in this area highly recommend it
i happened to stop in during happy hour you can t beat the pricing one of my rolls was deep fried and it was a tad over done unfortunately other than that it was
atmosphere is always fun and the food is good as long as you stick to chicken if you sit in the bar area try to sit in <unk> or suzie s section they are the best
great experience the waiter actually recommended having the ham and the sturgeon before our veggie dishes of <unk> eclair and cauliflower the ham was simple but delicious just a lot for two people and the sturgeon was a delight the carrot eclair is definitely worth checking out almost like a prosciutto smoked salmon the cauliflower is surprisingly rich and well known for a reason the wine pairings were delectable and spot on definitely recommend stopping by on any trip through montreal especially for the unique veggie dishes
i didn t eat here but i did indulge in the roof top bar good beer and a lovely view of pittsburgh good times
this is the perfect pizza place with the best pizza ever located in a beautiful suburb of las vegas but so worth the trip if you miss rush hour it is only minutes from downtown and worth the trip my son had the meat lover s pizza a beautiful looking pizza that tastes even better than it looks and that s saying a lot the sausage we were told was from a old family recipe as were the meatballs you have never had sausage like this sausage my wife had the white pizza and it was delicious too i always have pepperoni and olive which was delicious but i think this menu needs to be explored wish i was a local we finished the meal by splitting cheesecake to die for the cheesecake alone is worth the trip if you want to get away from the casinos and tourist food and have some real food in a family restaurant jump in the car get away from the casino madness and enjoy a great meal at biaggio s as we sat there it was clear that they treat everybody that comes in as family don t miss it
it s good but not as good as their locations in california in california they are amazing the wait times are a little crazy good food at good prices
i work in the service industry and am very understanding of service mishaps but this was really really bad i arrived and sat at the bar for mins before receiving a menu and finally had to ask for one whatever they were busy then ordered a side and waited for over mins for it reminded the bartender because maybe he forgot turns out he did forget but didn t communicate that to me okay stuff happens then waited another mins for my side that i now ordered mins ago now i m getting concerned and ask for a manager the manager calvin goes back to the kitchen and brings me a sandwich that i did not order i tell him that s not what i ordered and even if it was mins is a really long time to wait for a sandwich let alone a side which is what i actually ordered he then begins to argue with me that the ticket time was mins okay calvin firstly as a manager you never argue with the customer secondly if you had talked to your bartender you would have realized that he had forgotten to ring in my side then in the mins between when i had ordered and he actually put the order in he had forgotten and put the wrong order in we then decide at this point it s time to leave the bartender apologized for his mistakes the manager did not i give them a for customer service and restaurant management a pity really because i was really excited about the concept of this place i will never go there again or recommend them to anyone this was literally the worst restaurant experience i ve ever had i ve also never written a review before so thank you calvin for making me feel the need to download trip <unk> to alert people of your terrible customer service
one heck of a way to get out of the house on a rainy day and mix up what you re doing with a staff recommendation of one of the scores of games on the west wall it s cover each but then you re left free to stay and order drinks with usually amazingly friendly staff though not all give them something to go on like i d like a word game or party game for people etc and they ll spend the time and effort in recommending and even getting you started avoiding the instruction reading barrier it d get one more star if there were some decent food options
awesome hakka food and great quantities too we tried the chicken manchurian and chilly chicken most places these two dishes end up tasting very similar but not here there was a distinct difference is taste and boy did i love the chilly chicken it s spicy not fake spicy we also tried the veg hakka noodles which was good but i preferred the egg fried rice we had ordered we placed an order for dishes and the quantity will blow your mind away we ended up having to take it all home and it lasted for whole meals definitely worth a try and more ps the service is speedy so don t expect a lot of conversation the owners did however show up at the end to ask if we enjoyed the meal
atmosphere of stable pub is awesome and food has been really good also ordered for pickup and they were pretty quick would recommend
efficient staff with even measured decorum i had two eggs with <unk> and baked beans odd their <unk> is served in a market wrapped portion probably accessible in grocery stores soon all elements of the meal we re fine my wife had the egg benedict the hollandaise sauce was rather sweet but still pleasant really folks a good breakfast place but without the charm of a mom pop <unk>

this place is a good bang for the buck if you are looking to stuff your face full of reasonably tasting food for a reasonable price the meats taste interesting and different but they are just not that unique from other establishments like paramount foods or any other middle eastern joints the rice has a flavourful taste with some spices mixed in the prices are great and you can might be able to get away with buying one dinner for two people the restaurant itself is clean and quite large although located in a weird strip plaza type set up i do have to say that i was more impressed with some other bamiyan kabob places namely the one across from york university on <unk> st so the place is a ok <unk> with the criteria for stars out of nothing special but not to bad
i stayed here again for super bowl weekend and it was a lot of fun there are so many restaurants to choose from and most of them are really good i have some favorites and some that are not my favorites then you can walk on over to the palazzo side and find another casino and more restaurants there are also a lot of great shops here too the rooms are clean and huge mini bar tv s a sofa that turns into a bed a safe bath tub and shower are some of the room amenities i enjoy i never run out of things to do while staying here plus all the rooms are suites which i love that they are always very nice and accommodating from the time i leave till i go i started staying here and i got hooked because of the rooms and i also love to gamble here too the bathrooms are very nice and always someone in there keeping them clean it is an easy airport ride too if you take a cab and want to save ask the cab driver to take the streets and not the highway you will save about one way trip it is also easy to walk the strip from here it may be a long walk to the cosmo but it is about a minute walk to ceasars palace from here i like the location and the service the valet is always nice and they take very good care of my belongings every time i have had to check them in if you get the chance to be pampered please do go to the canyon ranch spa it is amazing it is huge one of the largest i have been to again friendly staff and very clean too the gym is also a good size and i really enjoy having breakfast right there when you are done do not forget to get your grazie card when you go here for perks also in the summer there are a lot of pools which you can walk from the outside on from one casino to the next which to me is faster than walking it inside the casino that is my opinion
i am currently here at applebee s writing this first off i must say our server yuri is fantastic however the chef here needs to find another job not around food of us ordered the for <unk> onion steak combo two with linguine and one with the margarita chicken steak rare one medium rare one well done and a children s steak well done with applesauce the well done steak was cooked perfectly the rare steak was cook a little more than expected the medium rare steak was blue rare inedible the children s steak was <unk> and came out minutes after the rest of our food sent back the children s and the medium rare children s came back medium at best medium rare came out a brand new steak more rare than the first time it s like they never even cooked it sent back a nd time called the manager over took my entree and my son s entree the issue dishes off the bill completely everyone was quite apologetic our server was over apologetic it was <unk> finally the rd time that they brought out my steak it was charred on the outside at least it was cooked on the inside all in all not a horrible experience but not as pleasant as past restaurant experiences
our server cali is awesome she s working so hard tonight too bad that she s is all by herself that s not right service was slow due to lack of staff not only did she greet us but sat us cleaned out table and served us not to mention waiting on all the people that are <unk> in despite of this she maintained a great attitude if i come <unk> come back it will be because of servers like her btw the soup is canned and salty the burgers were very good
this is the only way to end a trip to vegas the nutella was good but i couldn t finish it it was too sweet i suggest splitting with a friend one order sweet and the other savory don t go when they re busy they loose track of who ordered what they gave mine away last time twice
been here three times service has always been great food is plentiful and tasty be sure to watch the bus boys clean and set the tables amazingly fast and they look like they re having fun while they do it
had tried out a post lunch smoothie matcha talkin about <unk> from here nice blend of stuff including mangos without any overpowering flavors service was quick and friendly too a little hidden away only knew about this place from yelp searching but easy to get to once inside the main building also has some food options decently priced which i may try if walking around again
the oysters were awesome but the sushi was really dry and not worth the money if you want something worth the money shrimp tacos all the way and the shrimp appetizer it s a cool atmosphere i have had better service though good for a big group get together
we went to roys for the first time tonight everything was good the service was on point as far as the food we had lobster california roll and ebi roll were great starters my wife had lobster bisque which had a great curry type taste for main courses we had the braised short rib yukon mashed and greens we also had the lobster shrimp crab cake trio which was really delicious it is definitely worth checking this restaurant out if you are visiting vegas
absolutely love this place workers are very nice and accommodating very sweet and just overall pleasant to deal with on a saturday night it was very busy line was long but they were <unk> out the food left and right so the wait wasn t bad at all the quality of food is perfect with very few slip ups
authentic japanese food in a friendly atmosphere we had the savory tonkatsu ramen crispy and moist katsu chicken and perfectly sliced and fried vegetable tempura for dinner starters were gyoza get two orders these went so fast potato croquettes and age dashi tofu real green tea was a very pleasant surprise too i suppose the true testament to the quality of the food was the customer base over japanese tourists visitors in the time we were there
love this place so far went a few times nice and clean food is awesome you can also seat outside and it s beautiful love this place so far staff was nice and friendly one of my secret favorite places
good bacon n egg place waffles are great service is super fast and very good price wish the coffee was better coffee service food ambiance
only ever gotten delivery but the food is great delivery is fast and have yet to find an item i didn t like always get the chili it s bomb
after more than years in asia i recognize that real asian restaurants have a problem with authentic food frankly most americans really do not like itthis restaurant has hit the mark with food that is close enough to please those who want the real thing and those who want a great meal with an exotic difference real thai food is extremely hot this place knows how to make it to the taste of almost any customer portions are generous the ingredients are authentic and the results should please all
i used to only go to <unk> <unk> for viet subs and i m boring i only ever get the assorted but the long lines at lunch were quite brutal so i checked out <unk> <unk> one day and seriously has never gone back to <unk> <unk> the subs here are just as good i m only speaking for the assorted and i find the service friendlier
went here last night during charlotte restaurant week we went with our friends atmosphere is ok a bit loud but still enjoyable for the restaurant week menu they had the no name margarita to start with we all got it frozen it was a lot bigger than i anticipated so well worth it with the meal choice of appetizer was either queso or guacamole of us had the question and the guac both were very tasty our waiter made sure to keep our chip bowl filled so we could enjoy the guac and queso second course was either a salad or chicken tortilla soup we had both both tasted good main course was a choice of different entrees of us got the choice of three tacos and one got the tipsy chicken i really enjoyed the the turkey club carnita taco it has some sort of jalapeno bacon in it and it was really good for dessert the choice was either peanut butter chocolate pie or tres leches of us had the pie and had the tres leches the pie was really good as was the tres leches if in the area i would stop into the restaurant again
went here with a camp card for buy one get one free used once and they punched a hole in my card and told me the nd time i went its not valid apparently the cheap owner decided not to give more then use on a multi use coupon i will make sure to go to another dairy queen in the valley everytime i want dairy queen they also have the worst customer service saying it is policy and to call the manager it is a multi use coupon maybe the owner should learn what that means also good job wasting your product as i did not purchase the <unk> because i went to another dq that accepted the coupon your loss not mine hope the owner sees this message as i am also sending it to dq corporate
love this place everything is very fresh and the staff is always so nice best sushi burrito bowl in the area
cafe monarch is so good that i feel like it deserves not stars if only i could give them cafe monarch is an intimate and romantic restaurant in scottsdale the ambiance is absolutely perfect this is a perfect date night or event location and the design is rather unique the service is absolutely phenomenal in every way our server <unk> was basically a mind reader and the sommelier a member of the <unk> <unk> no less definitely knew his stuff the food was perfect and i really mean that it began with a sweet potato and pumpkin soup which was savory and perfectly accented with a bit of cinnamon the appetizer a salad with blood orange and prosciutto was possibly the best i have ever had in every sense the filet mignon was of course <unk> perfectly cooked perfectly seasoned and perfectly accented by an amazing sauce the dessert a rum cake accented the end of the meal perfectly alcohol wise this place rocks the wine was expertly paired and added to the meal significantly the cocktails were also excellent i had the winter wonderland which mixed delicious mint and cranberry with herbs and other delicious tastes needless to say this is possibly the best restaurant i have ever eaten at and i ve eaten at a lot
love that i can get my car washed and have lunch with the kids while we wait car wash service is great the service inside is a little slow but the people are not unpleasant they are never too friendly but kind nonetheless
really delicious dinner spot trendy so wear your outfit to be seen in only one complaint it was very loud reservations they do take them on open table it s gets busy so make a reservation we didn t have a reservation however they do have some lounge seating so we were able to sit there with full menu outdoor seating and bar they have a nice large patio with misters there are some stools around around the bar i couldn t tell if people were just drinking there or also eating service excellent service food was timed perfectly and they even split the dishes on separate plates a friend and i shared a salad and entree without us having to ask food the portions were quite large even the small plates section the trio of bruschetta is a great way to start the meal the mozzarella was a favorite of the group the best part of the meal was the sweet potato cannelloni very flavorful and well seasoned parking there are spaces in the area and a parking garage
my coworkers went there last week and they brought me philly cheese stake sandwich and i have to say it was delicious and tasty i went there the other other day to try it again and let me say that i can make a better cheese stake sandwich at home not the same i can t go back and pay bucks for another one sorry ea
nestled in what is for now a relatively sleepy corner of downtown urban bodega aka <unk> feels like something of a throwback to some of the small convenience stores i used to see line the roosevelt row neighborhood back when downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard <unk> dared to <unk> you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer to snacks to cooking essentials and even a few household cleaning items the relatively new pure <unk> apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo <unk> lining th avenue in downtown but for now the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car all the more reason <unk> s location makes sense you ll find <unk> on the bottom floor of the pure <unk> apartments on <unk> street just east of th avenue the <unk> of <unk> central market <unk> shawn <unk> you enter here through the front patio area where there s seating for eight by the way inside its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space behind the counter you can get coffee tea or even a sandwich made on the spot in front of the counter it s essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you d expect candy bars <unk> condiments snacks <unk> items beer wine soda as well as odds and ends like tissue paper shampoo and storage bags i can well imagine some downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to safeway and instead opting for a stop here for my first stop here on a saturday morning i opted to get a quick morning pick me up a tea and a sandwich i got their salted caramel iced tea also available hot and their turkey sausage egg cheese sandwich on an english muffin both made to order total cost including tax now to be fair they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we re not talking gourmet here still the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty i was also very happy with the tea almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents a solid breakfast so there you have it a locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood nothing pretentious just a good straight forward progressive independent convenience store even if you don t live in this quiet corner of downtown its worth a look or a sip and bite and it was in my case
i had one of the breakfast specials and it was fantastic there was also a continuous flow of coffee which is always nice probably just missed the church crowd so it wasn t too busy either definitely a good breakfast spot
us egg i <unk> thee with my first phoenix area four star rating how could i have forgotten about you definitely a breakfast place worth waiting for corn beef hash mmmmm
it s family friendly lively atmosphere comfortable seating and very yummy food service was quick and attentive we will be back
i have been to this cafe multiple types and it has always been a perfect experience it is a quaint spot with ample seating space they serve pilot coffee i have ordered both basic brew and americano at this location and they made it well
decent spot the tacos were ok nothing great the salsa and guacamole were great the service was ok
came here for a late lunch on a thursday place was pretty quiet but the waitress was very warm and welcoming she wasn t overbearing at all but still came to check on us periodically in case we needed anything as we were seated in the back room out of her view i ordered the curry lamb burger as per her suggestion and it was delicious well seasoned and juicy it s a flavorful spiced curry flavor and not a heat hot curry for those of you wary of spicy foods the mango chutney s sweetness balanced the curry very well i had the caesar side and was told it was more a watery dressing she wasn t wrong but i like to try caesar salads at different establishments i probably won t order that again my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken grilled cheese and he really enjoyed it i couldn t stop stealing his fries they were crispy and delicious we d definitely come back again to try the other menu items it was a tad early to start drinking for us but the bar specials looked great and alcohol was reasonable priced
what an amazing hidden gem great food service and extremely inexpensive considering the a quality of the food i highly recommend you try the hummus plate it s better than any greek or mediterranean place in the valley they also do a fantastic catering platter for those working lunches

there is a new restaurant in town great italian fusion fare and great wait staff can t wait to try the entire menu lunch and dinner jan t
it is not often that one gets to dine in a place where the service is flawless from start to finish il mulino is such a place their attention to detail in every aspect of the experience is nothing short of perfection during dinner i inadvertently knocked my purse off of the chair and before it hit the floor one of the staff was there to pick it up for me the most excellent service in the world wouldn t be the same without the food to back it up and i was delighted to find out everything we ordered was exquisite in addition to what you order off the menu diners are presented with complementary antipasti which begins with my favorite a giant wheel of parmesan cheese brought to the table and a generous hunk of cheese is cut off just for you it is quickly followed by heavenly garlic bread focaccia bread soft italian bread a plate of salami and bruschetta best ever with mussels no shellfish for me so i passed once we got around to ordering we started with a caesar salad which we split the dressing was perfect in flavor without being overpowering my husband ordered the fettuccine alfredo and he didn t speak for the entire time he ate which means it was amazing i ordered the whole <unk> which is cooked in rock salt presented for viewing impressive then <unk> and served with a light lemon olive oil dressing this was absolute perfection since we were celebrating my birthday the staff surprised me with a birthday dessert although i did not order one and a lively italian rendition of happy birthday it was the flourless chocolate cake never have i tasted a chocolate cake that amazing for as long as i have known my husband he has sung the praises of il mulino i am much more of a foodie than he is so i knew this must be something special if he was so excited about it he and a friend have made an annual pilgrimage to las vegas for many years and one of the biggest reasons is so they can dine at this restaurant together finally i was able to join him i can t wait until the next trip if it was possible to give stars i would do it
holy cow i am so glad i was talked into coming here and trying it out i was a little apprehensive at first since i was not sure what this place <unk> if it is your first time there the servers warn you not to expect large portions and suggest you order several plates if you want more of a variety with this in mind i ordered the shrimp risotto and the salmon the risotto came with jumbo shrimp and was a little more al dente in some parts than i would have cared for but was still good i also ordered the grilled salmon which was ok on its own but to me what really made the plate outstanding was the bed of oyster mushrooms that the salmon was served on the combination of the salmon and the mushrooms makes this plate a must try i was sufficiently satisfied after both of these plates my dining companion ordered the half roasted chicken unfortunately the plate lacked the wow factor the salmon had and the chicken lacked any flavor on its own and the broccolini it came with was way overcooked and inedible we ended up having to add salt to give the chicken any flavor the manager also surprised us with a mini cheesecake for my birthday yay which i thought was nice to top off the meal i had a smith <unk> hard cider yum and my companion had some drink can t remember the name that had raspberries in it unfortunately the bartender who made it forgot to strain the seeds out making it impossible to drink and it had to be sent back i had to knock a star off for the lack of flavor in the the chicken and the inconvenience of the drink would i come here again absolutely would i recommend you give it a try absolutely
i almost let everyone else s reviews affect mine everything i ate there was delicious and the portions were large i d write more but i went there to enjoy a nd time on and it was closed it looks like they were <unk> or something involving an angry orange sticker on the door it s too bad they were a great addition to the water st area
the salads we got prior to our main dish were fantastic they were better than the main dish itself i ordered the mixed grill with three types of protein and they were all bland in taste they were grilled nicely but just lacked flavor i may just go back for those salads
i haven t enjoyed a dinner like this in a while we each ordered separate flights of wine and created our own wine tasting they have many great wines to choose from both the food and service were fantastic oh and its a great singles hot spot for anyone in their s s
tasty burgers and fries loved mine with a root beer they were accomodating to our baby and provided a <unk> decor is very retro diner and a bit tired having read reviews i thought it was going to be diner decor but in a stylish way but it s actually just diner decor in a leftover way but the food is good and the crowd seemed to be steady so it s still something good
beach cafe what can i say haha that <unk> i have always been weary of trying new places i mean i love doing it but at the same time you re always scared it s a miss but considering it was in walking distance and i was in vegas this is the place to try new places me and my friend walked to here and from the get go it s a nice little cafe plenty of seating and everyone is pretty friendly there menu is nice i mean i wish they were in cali where the beaches are it makes me kind of sad cause honestly it beats out the one breakfast lunch place we have here but at least it gives me somewhere to look forward too when i come back me and my friend ended up coming six days out of the seven days we were here i ended up mainly getting the cafe breakfast with a bagel and bacon and their iced coffee i ll admit the first few times it was kind of watered down but it did its job and it s free refills their sun kissed iced tea is yummy and sweet too i did have their bbq bacon cheeseburger and fries and they were good too i mean i wish i had tried more variety but i m kind of a plain jane kind of guy the cafe breakfast ended up being my go to and i m not a huge breakfast person they also have specials here and there they had a captain crunch french toast that was to die for the prices were fair i usually ended up paying about for my food and drink on top of it if you re the type to frequent this place ask for a meal card you get a free meal after about i believe or meals but hey free food is always good
yum this place is a hidden gem really good american brunch lunch menu with a korean twist this bibimbap plate was so incredibly delicious highly recommend everyone to give it a try especially henderson folks looking to avoid eating at chain restaurants super nice servers and quick service
so lets begin with the fact that this review is due to the performance of a single employee at this location who ruined the entire experience a few friends and i came in to grab a quick and delicious meal at what has always been one of my favorite little places got in just before the rush which is always nice everything was fine until we reached the condiments section of the building process the young lady has no sense of any kind of listening skills my fiance asked for hot salsa cheese and guacamole instead he got lettuce i don t know on what planet lettuce and guacamole sound the same but whatever maybe its because they are the same color when we cried out no the young woman looked up at us she rolled her eyes at me and said what thats what you ordered i looked at her and said no he said guacamole and the <unk> continued chipotle girl do you want me to take it off fiance yes please that would be great <unk> there its off still a mountain of lettuce covering the majority of the burrito fiance can you please get at least the big pieces off please or could you maybe remake it instead of removing the rest or just simply remaking the item she literally takes guacamole and covers the remaining lettuce and rolls the burrito closed <unk> its fine the way it is last time i check its not your call as to if its fine or not another girl standing on the line next to her made a face to me as if to say oh my god i m sorry she s crazy the problem associate then with a fierce attitude tossed the item into a basket and almost knocked it off of the counter i ve literally never has a worse experience from any other establishment the manager on duty was busy so i chose not to bother her the restaurant was beginning to fill and i didn t want to take away from anyone else s experience in closing i m pretty sure mouthing off to a customer isn t in the chipotle employee <unk> our entire group was completely taken aback by the complete disregard for any kind of professionalism i know it seems silly but i was really upset by it
decided to try rustic cafe for breakfast the decor of the cafe was very nice the staff was very welcoming and accommodating the wait staff helped us with our orders i ordered scrambled eggs bacon hash browns and raisin toast the food arrived hot unfortunately the eggs were not scrambled i m finding that some restaurants are not scrambling the eggs but just cooking them like they are prepping an omelet leaving them flat and not fluffy such is the case with rustic cafe the eggs were rubbery and near dry bacon and hash browns were good raisin toast was overly dry served with country crock margarine not to my liking ended up eating maybe half the dish my wife order a breakfast burrito and found the eggs to be in the same condition she ate less than half of her breakfast don t know if they used real eggs or eggs in a carton but the rustic cafe has potential just needs lessons on how to cook good eggs let the wait staff know of our dissatisfaction but no accommodations were made will not return
i ve hit up <unk> a few times for lunch because it s close to the office the sushi itself is pretty good nothing too inventive but a couple off the wall rolls the <unk> on the rainbow roll was super fresh and the wasabi was pretty delightful as well i ve only had rolls here so i can t comment on the chinese portion of the menu service is usually hit or miss but i think they do their best could just be an <unk> issue the prices are a little high i mean the restaurant is in the orleans not on the strip i expect them a little higher because they are located in a casino hotel but i just thought they were a touch too high i ve had better but i ve had a hell of a lot worse
chris bianco is a god among men as far as i m concerned that said italian restaurant leaves me flat the portions are miniscule and it s pasta maybe it s just me but i never feel right paying out the ass for pasta what i had was terrific but was it that much more terrific than what i could ve made at home yes probably but if i m going to splurge on a cuisine it s going to be sushi or indian or pizza i suppose that s what i loved about pizzeria bianco you felt like you were getting the best pizza in the country for a song italian restaurant is not like that at all also our service wasn t so hot i m talking minute gaps between seating and drink orders and food orders we ll be back and maybe like dave w s review below it ll get better i hope so
i m and i ve officially had the best meal of life as of last night i went to fleming s in feb for my b day with a group of friends and it was very good then but i was more focused on visiting and b day festivities to notice how good it was plus we had appetizers at brio before so my husband and i decided to take our year old daughter out to a nice dinner last night let me start by saying steve was our waiter and he was such a nice down to earth guy he was just the right <unk> of attentive not to pushy which is a huge plus with us now about the food we ordered calamari too start off and were served wonderful bread butter there were kinds of gourmet <unk> accompanying the bread a brie one and a smoked gouda one i think now imagine butter mixed with both of those cheeses delish the calamari was run of the mill but it had spicy peppers in it which was positive for us we like anything hot for salads its a must for me to order a blue cheese wedge when ever one is available it was so good it had a huge slice of blue cheese on it plus the bacon that we all love so much my daughter ordered a ceasar salad for her meal the greens were so fresh and crisp this salad also had fried capers on it which gave it a crunch for our entrees we ordered the sea bass and the course meal that included an ounce filet with crab stuffed lobster tails it also included a crunchy grilled sweet squash or similar vege i wanted the sauteed mushrooms and my husband wanted mashed potatoes all the sides were amazing couldn t imagine a better meal and i ve eaten at a lot of the local casino steak houses the course entree came with a pumpkin cheesecake and it was a nice slice and tasted fresh and homemade i had one glass of wine husband had cocktails bill was not including tip i know that seems high bit it was so worth it for us this is a great special occasion place i did see they had happy hour but we had our babe with us so couldn t try that in the bar do your self and your loved ones a favor and eat here love
came to border grill for my sisters bachelorette and it was a fun time with the girls but the food was ok service was slow maybe we got there late and staff was over us also it took forever to get water hello am hungover the food i think had great balance and lovely presentation but the rice was hard and cold and so was my tortillas very cold i ate and didn t complain i was starving probably won t go back
had dinner and drinks with a friend on a friday night we sat downstairs at the bar the bartender was very friendly and attentive we opted for the special the fishbowl for the was more than enough alcohol for the two of us
this is the best bbq i ve ever had i keep coming back day after day just to get the whole menu the sandwiches are fantastic and the meat is tender and juicy the garlic ranch dressing is good on just about anything
on thursday at roughly pm the bar tender female long dark hair was taking the order from people in our group all of us were making large orders all with special requests we were not simply ordering the burger we were ordering different kinds of foods and toppings salads or potatoes with or with out the extras medium medium well etc its a lot to try to remember when there are different orders and the bartender was not writing anything down she took my friends orders and by the time she had gotten to me i asked her if she was sure she didnt want to write this stuff down and she snapped back at me by saying are you fucking kidding me i have a lot of customers can you just tell me what you want i was shocked and said i dont want anything im fine dont worry she then continued to attack me by saying now your fucking insulting me tell me what you want i told her that i dont want anything im fine this will be my last beer she walked away and my friends were asking me what was that all about i explained to them how she swore at me twice the bar tender over heard me and said i can say what ever the fuck i want i told her i would be letting the owner know how she was acting and what she had said to me and she responded by saying go ahead the owner will your ass because i can do what ever the fuck i want i offered to pay for my drinks and leave she wouldnt let me pay this place is usually a pretty decent place they tend to get your food order wrong but if you can get past that its a decent little pub i will never return to this place and neither will my group of friends not as long as the people who work there are allowed to talk to customers in such a way horrible service
stars for the service for the food we were lucky and ended up with a great server she brought us whole carafes of hot water and coffee in addition she came back a couple times to check on us to make sure we were doing ok
sometimes i get a real hankering for indian food we decided by the reviews we read to try tandoori times love it we ve been back a few times since everything i ve tried there i ve loved my favorite is the saag ghost my only disappointment is that they don t serve pakora s at dinner and i never make it there for lunch but they redeemed themselves by having one of my favorite white wines on the menu <unk> the belly dancer is cool just make sure you don t sit under one of the speakers in the ceiling they crank it
it s an airport i know but you can get a good meal just not at this place the chicken tacos are horrible the fries i m sure are form yesterday service pretty bad
tonight s the first time i ordered from here it s really good the ribs are tender and the sides are good great bbq that s ready in minutes definitely will order from here again their customer service was great as well all around pleased
last night was the first time i tried pete s fish and chips as the name suggests fish and chips should be the best item on the menu sadly i ordered a three piece fish and chips i expected delicious fish unfortunately the fish is a frozen patties yuck i ordered the onion rings they claim they are battered not so once again frozen processed food my rings were not hot and i asked for hot rings so i watched them tossed back into the fryer and they served me over cooked rings pete does have a tasty sauce and good thing it was the only way to eat processed food now that i know what they serve when i want fish chips and rings i will find another place
came here for brunch and it was delicious between the of us we ordered a combination of the french toast prosciutto eggs benedict oysters and built our own omelettes mimosas and bloody mary s of course i m super critical of brunch because it is my favorite meal and i can honestly say that the breakfast potatoes are the best i ve ever had the ambience is beautiful felt like we were brunching in the <unk> so glad we found a brunch spot that isn t on the strip we heard dinner is excellent too so we ll definitely be back
i have my own nonna so when i found out that this place was run by old school italians i was overjoyed my experience with them after many visits is that despite their kind demeanour the food is nothing like home cooking the sauce is so heavy on the oregano and <unk> tomato concentrate and it tastes as if they add sugar to reduce the acidity very <unk> because the sauce is so poor their sandwiches taste like the ones you get pizza pizza their chicken <unk> is cafeteria level pepperoni pizza features pepperoni straight from the packaged cold cut aisle at no frills the saving grace here is the primavera pizza if you can stand the hour wait this at least is reliable and decent
food was yummy waldorf chicken salad and california club pizza service was awesome natasha was an amazing waitress give her a raise
we went for brunch i liked the concept pay flat and you get unlimited tapa plates and you can add bottomless mimosas unfortunately the quality of the food and service was below par especially for the price some of the plates were ok most of them not that great one of my first plates came out cold great idea i just think they need to brush up on quality service and food preparation our server did not check on us enough making the whole process a lot longer also they let the plates stack up which is a pet peeve of mine since i ve worked in the industry for a long time i hate when people don t bus their tables it s simple when you drop off a plate you should be picking up one our service in general was slow at one point i think we were sitting and waiting to order a drink for almost mins
for a sandwich anyways i don t think the sandwiches live up to the <unk> basic and mediocre we got the tomato soup and the chicken chipotle sandwich the tomato soup was way too sweet and had giant chucks of soggy bread in it absolutely disgusting the sandwich wasnt anything spectacular i can probably make a better sandwich using my week old vegetables and chicken rotting away in my fridge
have you ever thought a place was good and later discovered that its really not my disappointment with a young waitress who forgot to enter my phone order and only did so when i arrived to pick it up was actually a benefit to me in that i realized a few things about this place and its cleanliness which is so lacking to understand that simply have a seat at the bar and look around for a few minutes if you do that you will see stacks of cardboard boxes to your left with supplies shoved onto an open shelf feed lines from a slushie machine that doesn t look like it had been used or cleaned in years the area is filled with fruit flies that are circling around leaked syrups and other liquids if you look to the right you will see tons of <unk> in spider clumps with old monitors and other discarded but still in place sign technology if you see all this in an area that is open to customers i can only imagine what the kitchen looks like the thought of that <unk> my thoughts while i tried to eat a mango salad that was prepared with old mangos and a ginger beef dishes that was swimming in liquid and onions with about thin small pieces of beef i have eaten there on many occasions where i thought the food was okay not great but okay however i usually walk in go to the assigned table and don t see much of the service areas after experiencing the sites of the bar area i <unk> to never eat at axia again until they clean up their place i can t believe they have ever passed a health inspection
<unk> plates our table of five ordered the tortelli di <unk> alla <unk> stuffed pasta <unk> alla <unk> stuffed pasta risotto alla milanese con ossobuco and <unk> con <unk> e <unk> dolce al <unk> rabbit casserole and we all left needing a second meal everything was tasty and i was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable the <unk> stuffed savoury pasta tasted osso bucco was tender and the rabbit was moist and perfectly seasoned but gosh everything but the osso bucco was served in dishes no larger than tea plates long story made short tasty food but i wouldn t visit again because my stomach is bigger than the size of a marble
although i have went here many times since my first review i have to comment on my most recent visit for a late lunch early dinner yesterday we were the only people in there so we sat at the bar my original plan was to have my standard crab cake but after talking with the wonderful bartenders women can t remember their <unk> me while having my cocktail i opted for bay of <unk> salmon with maple dijon glaze and goat cheese and pecans omgosh what was i thinking to never order this dish it was absolutely incredible i have never had a salmon dish done so perfectly the glaze and the toppings pecans and goat cheese were made in heaven for the <unk> was beyond amazing i must have <unk> with delight about times during my meal it comes with their simple but wonderful herbed basmati rice and asparagus my lunch date had the daily special of a chicken wrap he was thrilled with his choice as well also recommended by the bartenders as luck would also have it a wine rep came in while we were having lunch and we were invited to do some tastings with the manager the rep and the bartender we truly struck gold on our visit yesterday great way to spend a cold dreary monday afternoon
delicious gluten free pizza crispy crust flavorful meat topping fresh side salad delivered quickly loved it
i recently went to nakama for the first time for a first date many <unk> that night starting with the bad we made dinner reservation for and were a few minutes late we were told that we lost our spot and had the choices to either wait a half hour to minutes sit at the sushi bar or just order food at a table without the hibachi experience we opted to get a drink at the bar and wait it out this was a wednesday evening and the place was packed no seats available at first so we checked out the drink menu and finally we got a couple of chairs the drinks were decent i m a lightweight so they were good for me it worked out that we waited for the hibachi because we were able to be squeezed in within ten minutes i got hibachi seasame chicken and my date got nakama tuna steak he also ordered sushi but our waiter had forgotten to bring it it was really no problem because the portion sizes are pretty big and we probably couldn t have ate the sushi anyways i have no complaints about my chicken it definitely exceeded my expectations based on the other reviews i have seen for it my date goes there on the regular and so his tuna steak obviously has his coming back for more the onion soup was by far one of the better japanese soups i have had it has a kick to it that i haven t tasted anywhere else our hibachi chef was wonderful he was entertaining easy to talk to and was really good at his job he even let us all try a little fried rice i always have had reservations about nakama because i thought it was an <unk> restaurant that jacked its prices up because of its trendy reputation i really enjoyed my time there it was clean and had a lot of energy i ll be back again
love this place this is a true definition of a neighbourhood gem i have been to this place twice and both times they have been amazing i first stumbled upon this place after seeing it on an <unk> post and then i realized i go to that area from time to time so the next time i was in the neighbourhood my hubby and i decided to have some saturday lunch now initially i was all set to try their new brunch menu but <unk> the lunch specials we changed our minds we had their pasta special which was penne with pancetta and tomato sauce crispy green beans with truffle aioli and freshly baked pizza with basil mozzarella and burrata mouth watering deliciousness in every bite and we were too full for dessert fast forward weeks later we returned with some friends and had dinner there they have weekly specials including pizza on wednesday and pasta on thursday with purchase of a drink very reasonable deals portions are pretty good as well this time we ordered the calamari eggplant parm i ordered the <unk> <unk> and my hubby ordered the bosco pizza my friends ordered the lamb ragu <unk> and the mushroom risotto lamb ragu i love <unk> the pasta was great but i don t eat lamb since i dont like their gamey taste i almost wished they had an option of beef ragu or pork ragu as an alternative the <unk> is great the seafood was fresh the sauce is very rich rose and it s great with some fresh pepper and parmesan i wasn t able to finish my pasta but my hubby got into the leftovers before i could the next day calamari was huge serving we all ate it and could barely finish lol calamari was light crispy battered and the calamari wasn t too chewy which was great the eggplant parm was another favourite the tomato sauce was great with the eggplant one of my friends <unk> t like eggplant but when he ate the eggplant parm he loved it the bosco pizza is amazing i would say all their pizzas are amazing so generally one wont be disappointed it s just all about the toppings i really liked the bosco i ts a bit enhanced from the typical margherita which is my preferred pizza but it s still really nicely balanced crust is soft and flaky and every bite is just so so good the mushroom risotto i always say try the risotto in a restaurant if you wanna know if they are good and i m so glad i got a taste of that from my friend because this risotto is underrated when i look at reviews i keep seeing all the other pastas being featured esp the baked cheesy pasta but the mushroom risotto was memorable it was soft but still <unk> texture and the mushroom flavour was intense but not overpowering i almost wish i swapped plates with my friend anyway next time i m back i definitely will be trying the risotto all to myself the dessert we were very full but all of us managed to try their tartufo which was freaking amazing loved every bite of it if you re ever in the area definitely pop by to give it a try ambience is great lots of space and they even have a private room for bigger groups functions i would love to have like a party here sometime amalfi coast i will be back
caught up with bearden s on a sunny afternoon in november a fine fresh double and very big onion rings were delivered to my table in under minutes quaint and bright dining room very clean and family friendly spot would love to try a shake next time much better than average burger a little pricey but they are offering half price wednesday burgers for a limited time look forward to coming back soon
way over priced meh peking duck however they are over priced in beijing too so not surprising duck was a bit cold when served the duck shaped pastries and mustard boneless duck feet are good but again too pricey a place for business meeting rather than a place for the actual food
had a great meal even though the sushi chef was on vacation my wife and i love the tapas half plate option the shrimp and grits are out if this world i asked for a small plate of roasted peppers with our caprese salad
had great lunch here friends more familiar with korean cuisine claimed it to be almost the same food they had in korea tried the different kimchi available and was impressed with the flavors will definitely go back
i absolutely love korean food and tonight i had the <unk> craving for a big hot bowl of <unk> i didn t even care that it was out i wanted my soup naturally i turned to yelp and found jun s korean restaurant my mom and i walked into the restaurant and we immediately turned to each other in awe of how clean the establishment is i m talking ridiculously clean i appreciate restaurants with cleanliness like jun s everyone needs to get on their level there are plenty of dishes to choose from but i couldn t stray away from my craving we both ended up ordering the <unk> or in <unk> s terms spicy beef and vegetable soup each bowl of soup included two banchan banchan is one of my favorite things about korean food we went with the cucumbers daikon kimchi and tofu all of which were very flavorful and fresh the banchan dishes were not small like other korean joints i have been to but a good portion the <unk> arrived to our table in a big bowl piping hot just how i like it the broth had the right amount of spiciness to it and the chunks of beef brisket were tender vegetables in the soup included bean sprouts black mushrooms carrots green onions and onions the vegetables were simmered to the point where they were just soft enough but not mushy overall a very filling and satisfying meal especially when served with a small bowl of rice service at jun s is fast and friendly i m not complaining my korean food craving was satisfied and i can t wait to come back and try other dishes the bbq and bibimbap looks amazing
this place was a huge disappointment everything was bland and i mean bland salad had gobs of dressing on it potatoes and steak were completely unseasoned and i swear the cheesecake tasted like it came from the grocery store i don t usually leave reviews but i was so annoyed after leaving that i had to figured i should save someone else the mistake of spending bucks here the price is outrageous for what you get do yourself a favor and don t come here just don t
we were starving but the food was eh at best endless mimosas always make things better but it was pre mixed weak and refill was slow loved the cheesecake
this place was awesome the atmosphere was very welcoming but the food was truly special we had the fried ravioli and a pizza both were excellent the use of fresh ingredients was obvious in the taste of the food the crust of the pizza was wonderful i would recommend this place
we tried this place randomly for lunch yesterday i had heard that it was an excellent seafood place but i have to admit i was slightly disappointed upon being seated we were informed of the new lunch <unk> it s an extremely <unk> menu it s basically all sushi at this point so if you don t like sushi you re screwed i do love sushi fortunately but my wife was recovering from a sore throat and would have appreciated different options my edamame was completely unsalted and since this is one of those i know better than you do places there wasn t salt on the table i find it super annoying to have to ask for basic condiments like salt and pepper it s a bit condescending i had the snap <unk> and pop roll which was quite good the unagi eel nigiri was decent i ve honestly had better unagi though service was great our waiter was nice and attentive i d like to try this place again for dinner but if i m looking for sushi in the clt there are spots i enjoy more
this place has got it together i was clearly leading with my stomach when i walked in here during lunch rush the line was sooooooo long literally about people deep i considered walking out but took a chance and <unk> it out i only waited about minutes everyone in the line was so quick but very courteous and made everything to order everyone was smiling and having a great time while being super busy one staff member was in training the menu options are great the ingredients are fresh and delicious get a side of the salad dressing it s unbelievably good i described it as the best ranch you have ever had with a kick and a bit of something green
i love their hummus platter and their california club pita it s quite the hip place and always busy i d rather do take out than stay in because it s just busy and loud and i m a grumpy old lady busy means slower service too but the food is good
made two visits within the last days incredibly impressed with the bagels and the integrity of a good bagel growing up in the northeast you understand good italian cuisine bread and especially bagels the owner is super friendly and recognized that i was from the northeast once he recognized my college <unk> and we got to talking about growing up in northeast pa the bagels we ordered are authentic and something you will not find in northeast <unk> me feel right at home atmosphere friendly service and delicious bagels makes for a great place to patronize will be a return customer for sure thanks so much
i don t think i m coming back my burger was just as bad as the one i had at the zoo after the first bite i wished i had gone to in n out or burger king for that matter the habit adds no flavor to their char burgers the french fries were soggy and awful too i don t understand these star reviews if the managers and staff are very friendly it s only to make up for the bland tasting food
i love this place the service is great and the food is amazing and you cant beat unlimited house wine with your meal i have almost tried everything on the menu now and so far have not found something i didnt like
i had the vindaloo curry chicken set on medium it was absolutely perfect my partner had the tandoori chicken which i have never had and he gave me a piece it was great too no complaints whatsoever love the mom and pop places definitely recommended
<unk> tour is a wrap time for tacos tried the fish tacos can t say they were great too much cabbage not enough sauce the fish seemed fresh for two tacos and chips left me wishing for something more or i m just a cheapo i would definitely go back and i would definitely ask for more sauce because it was pretty tasty
we had an amazing experience here all thanks to this blonde girl bartender with a <unk> ring wish we could remember her name she went above and beyond what we asked for to make sure our experience was wonderful she was friendly inviting and accommodating we ll be back
tried <unk> for the first time and all of our food was great exactly what we were looking for love that we could order and pay online very convenient we had pizza wings yum and dessert they gave us free breadsticks too all so very filling and excellent tasting this is our new go to pizza place we ll have to eventually try some other items on the menu as well very pleased
this was our first visit to <unk> caf and it couldn t have been better we came with friends who have eaten here several times in the past and always have good things to say about it we both ordered french onion soup and the skewer garden salad the skewers come with shrimp or scallops so i ordered one of each both were very good our friends ordered a chicken pot pie and a salmon dinner they both had nothing but good things to say about their meals we are always looking for new restaurants to try some we can t wait to go back and some we hope to never see again this one s a keeper we ll be back soon and often
enchiladas were good not as spicy as i thought they would be with the jalape o drizzle good service a true sports bar with horse racing available for those who like the track
i used to love mi taco pause for laughter their shrimp tacos were heavenly and much like every other fast food burrito taco place in toronto you could choose your toppings custom bowls for everyone but sadly things have changed you can now only order off of a menu of pre arranged items if you don t want something you have to go through the add this take away this are there any other options for this process it was so much easier when my choices were beautifully freshly laid out in front of me gone are your rice options and the bright green lettuce is now replaced with brown <unk> pieces of what i am assuming was once leaves it s a pain to look through my order to ensure that substitutions are there and items aren t missing this may seem picky but having the ability to make a custom bowl or taco was what i loved about this and all burrito places next time i ll skip my once beloved mi taco and instead take the extra steps to mucho burrito where my options are a plenty
their fried chicken is slow cooked to perfection that means even the breast is flavorful and not dry
the only thing better than the exquisite food is the friendly service i struggled not to spend my entire stay in the phoenix area at the cafe i would strongly recommend this establishment to anyone visiting the area or anyone who wants delicious food and a relaxed atmosphere
i ve been here twice once for a friend s baby shower and tonight for dinner with a friend kind of torn about this place right now tonight we were greeted and sat right away i really like the porch and couch was very comfy our cocktails were brought out fast they have a nice selection of skinny drinks i got a skinny margarita it wasn t good my friend got the skinny bitch which was pretty good i ordered the bruschetta and honestly it was just ok i ve had better cough postinos cough not a fan of the prosciutto they need a higher quality meat and are too heavy handed on the fig jam chicken salad bruschetta not a fan of that one either my friend ordered the caprese sandwich which was very good flavorful crunchy on the outside inside was warm and melted in your mouth the accompanying salad was good too our meal was equally a hit and miss curiously enough service was good and i love the atmosphere it wasn t all that bad overall so i m willing to give it another shot perhaps happy hour <unk> how can the service be pretty good here and awful at the sushi room next door i thought they are owned by the same owners
i visited yesterday and i have to say that i was impressed my first time here and the guys working were very helpful and answering any questions i had i had recently converted to <unk> so i ve been trying out a bunch of new foods and recipes i purchased some <unk> while i was here it was delicious i will definitely be back thank you for putting up with my questions will recommend this place <unk> <unk>
as being from los angeles i grew up with sam woo i really like their simple but delicious soup noodles noodle plates rice dishes bbq pork and all sorts of cooked chinese dishes never was disappointed until i visited this sam woo somehow this sam woo is different while it offers the same type of dishes found at other sam <unk> the food here is not especially well prepared on the very greasy side and quite surprisingly expensive for what you re getting upon my latest and most likely last visit i had the wonton soup noodle bowl and chicken lo mein there was nothing wrong with the soup noodle bowl but it could use some more chinese broccoli the chicken lo mein was in my mind an utter disaster instead of the fat <unk> smooth lo mein noodles it was prepared using thin <unk> egg noodle which was all degrees of wrong i ate this stuff all my <unk> can t fool me the chicken pieces were bland and the noodles where swimming in grease the only thing on that plate that was decent was the chinese broccoli besides that i would never ordered this plate if i ve known prices here are typically more than any other sam <unk> i ve been to service was of course crappy with minimal acknowledgment i even had to ask for change back as they assume the extra were for them giving them such a big tip for sub par servicei think not
typically vegas it tries to be a high end restaurant but doesn t follow the rules nor the <unk> of what one would expect in a fine dining establishment i would suggest table cloths and a dress code i didn t need to see all of the notches in the tables neither did i need to see young men dressed in hurley t shirts plaid shorts and <unk> <unk> dude are you sure it s ok to eat steak it hasn t been forty five minutes since we ve been out of the pool oh the future of america sometimes i m glad i ll be dead back to the restaurant i ordered the wild game trio with a side of foie gras i received dry meat and no goose liver oh well my partner had the bison ribeye and said that it was pretty good and well cooked good for her since we used her myvegas points to get off we also had the creamed spinach and the truffle mac and cheese i thought they were ok my partner gave them two thumbs up if she wasn t lying here next to me i d tell her to get her own yelp account but she had the coupon and she also has the hey <unk> <unk> and if i want to keep dipping my meat into her sauce i d best behave anyway back to the restaurant we also had the soup trio lobster bisque onion and leek and wagyu chili chili was nice and spicy the lobster bisque was more bisque than lobster and the onion leek soup was not as smooth as anticipated we also had the short rib ravioli they were good but we just wished that they were warmer for dessert we had the trio chocolate cake souffle cheesecake and creme brulee the creme brulee was excellent and came with a flaky buttery cookie that would make a dane weep my recommendation if you have a myvegas coupon go and try it out i would suggest other options if one had to pay full price
you go <unk> but high class proteins as far as the mouth can drool we went for their saturday night gourmet buffet dinner and omg was it freaking good name your surf and or turf and i swear they had it as an option king crab snow crab several different mussel dishes ceviche sushi several types of fish rack of lamb steak prime rib etc we where challenging ourselves to find a chicken dish and the six of us couldn t find one anywhere on the spread also no matter what we tried was made with top quality ingredients and very fresh for under before tax and tip this is a huge huge value for your money you must go even if you re not a fan of buffets
horrible horrible service it was like we were bothering them i don t understand i work customer service everyday and i know how to treat customers not here i will never go eat here again and would never recommend this wendy s to anyone the management needs to seriously look at how people are being treated here then when the food finally came the order was all wrong i didn t even bother to let them know
the menu is basic but provides a good range of tasty items the greek fries are very well done not fried to a crisp but just right seasoning and cheese on top make for the perfect starter the pizzas are undoubtedly some of the best in the city whether it be make your own or one of the many house combinations you won t be disappointed recommend getting the whole wheat base as it s helps with the post stomach <unk> of pizza eating the tandoori special is to die for and the vegan pizzas are too notch atmosphere is very cozy and the service is always a joy highly recommend a visit here people
just from a tourist s point of <unk> is one of the hotels i love visiting in vegas their decor is <unk> the realistic sky to the backdrop of italian boutiques it was photo galore i definitely took many pics here next time i ll stay here and maybe try the gondola ride it looks ultra <unk>
this review is for their weekend dinner i ve been coming here for the past couple years and i do appreciate the consistency that is provided here it s no longer the must try buffet on the strip eg bacchanal buffet at caesar s bally s sterling brunch but i m glad the quality here hasn t diminished significantly price for dinner was which wasn t too bad compared to the higher end buffets i mentioned above came here at pm on saturday night and the line was still kind of long it looked like a one hour wait luckily i took advantage of the mlife pearl status and got to skip the line quick tip if you are staying at a m life hotel you can bill your meal to your room so that you can rack up mlife tier credits the food was pretty good here their premium items were pretty good eg prime rib crab legs shrimp cocktail they also had lamb chops and a peppered hangar steak that were pretty darn good the dessert that i especially enjoyed was the white chocolate cone would definitely recommend that this is still one of the better value buffets on the strip it doesn t have the flash design or variety of the buffet at the wynn or bacchanal but if you just want to have a good dinner buffet that doesn t break the bank the buffet at bellagio is a pretty safe bet
this was a decent buffet definitely not the best my grandparents used to rave about this buffet so i was excited to try everything was ok and they had a great variety but the taste was a little meh we got in by sitting at the bar it s a secret that most people don t know if there is a huge line walk up front and ask if there is bar seating available the first thing we were excited about was the kobe beef it looked so beautiful and delicious but we were wrong the meat was so hard and so tough it could have been kobe but it was a very cheap cut which is how they are serving so much of it we passed our plates to the server we couldn t eat it and both felt bad then we went to the sushi which was pretty good i ate as much of that as i could i felt like the quality was pretty good the rest of the items were ok nothing was very special i will say that it was a fun buffet with great servers i will come back in hopes that the food got a little better though i admit it must be hard to make that much food every night
fresh food super tasty and the staff and the owner are really nice and helpful definitely recommend everyone give this place a try
i don t eat thai food a lot so i can t tell whether it s authentic or not but the food is really good really miss dry noodles a lot and pad thai is just soo good also miss spicy food and can t believe is almost too much for me okay will still try next time <unk> the hot feeling in your mouth is sooo wonderful very thai style environment and nice staff as a whole the only inconvenience is you need to go to the counter to check out
big let down got the pulled pork sandwich and was dry pork which was coated in season ate half and all you could taste was seasoning wife had a chicken sandwich and same thing all seasoning flavor doused in hot sauce to many tables crowded together service was lousy didn t even check on our drinks basically brought stuff out and left wasn t even crowded on a thursday at big fail
a darling place that s hot in the summer cold in the winter and quirky in all seasons delicious homemade chai none of this oregon chai nonsense and a fun menu of kefte on mondays couscous with vegetables on wed the hummus comes in generous proportions plus free wireless
unappealing big pieces of pulled chicken on my tasteless chicken taco salad not enough lettuce or tomato either long trek to the restaurant no plans to return
popped in there today after lunch this place has still <unk> its standards in terms of variety especially for bottled condiments for chinese vietnamese and filipino cooking their packaged noodles section is extensive with many different varieties of packaged noodles representing different <unk> in the <unk> they don t carry too many korean or japanese products except for cookies and a few soy and wasabi pre mixed sauces from japan the fruit and vegetables section is hit and miss but they carry a good selection of produce the moose is always a good place to shop
i agree with the star comments this place looks good but the food is nowhere near as good as the restaurants decorative trimmings i sat outside i only wish i had read these reviews before eating there and spending just under on a meal that i could have prepared myself serving food that is spoiled is not cool this was my first and last visit
great food ice cold beer and fairly attentive wait staff the layout is also roomy and inviting the management s tendency to close off areas <unk> that are ideal for watching a game at a booth or table regardless of how many people are in the bar is off putting i was also <unk> while visiting several weeks ago to be presented a bill for for two large stone ipa i d never encountered prices like these in any previous visits so this left a bad taste in my mouth as i was leaving i m a local dammit why charge me las vegas strip prices
we love this mcdonald s at sunset and eastern across from sunset park it is our favorite spot for morning coffee and breakfast the dining area is always very clean and the staff is friendly and accommodating the manager runs a tight ship which really shows in the atmosphere and quality here we ve tried several other mcd s in the surrounding area they don t compare great coffee great service free wifi newly decorated a
i m not a big sushi eater but what i ate was delicious got the california rolls yes i am not adventurous and shrimp tempura yummmmm this place is kinda pricey and this is the first time i ve ever paid for japanese long grain rice it s ok though i was on vacation so it was ok to splurge i also had the tastiest lychee martini complete with a liquor soaked lychee at the bottom i also heard some amazing house music being played here while we ate our dinner probably the best i heard all weekend
i went to the north premium outlets yesterday and came to this one today i personally think that the indoor one would be better for the winter however the selection here isn t as great as the one at the north premium outlets there are less stores and less items in each of the stores there are less people at this one compared to the other one even though it is smaller it is still a great place to shop at and people are very friendly definitely worth stopping by if you re near
second time eating at habit although first time at this location burger was still delicious but the onion rings had way too much salt there isn t too much seating at this location so we had to hover around a table anxiously waiting for a family to leave my wife likes smashburger a bit better
so many people have already posted about the soup dumplings and it s true they are delicious we have visited twice and both time have ordered and eaten enough food for people we have tried szechuan style wontons these came with spicy glass noodles as well as the wontons very nice with lots of heat pork vegetable and shrimp pot stickers i adore that these are steamed and then friend like a pancake and you have to break the pot stickers out they were yummy and so uniquely presented pan fried green onion pancake chris wasn t a huge fan it wasn t something he would order again don t get me wrong it wasn t bad but when everything else is so good you just can t waste stomach room on less than stellar items pork soup dumplings these have a darker soup broth which gives them a completely different flavor than the pork and crab soup dumplings they are filled with warm soup and really good pork and shrimp shu mai these are one of my favorites tons of flavor try them with some red oil pork and crab meat soup dumplings these are hands down one of the top best things i ve ever eaten the broth in these is light and loaded with flavor i would eat an entire bowl of just the broth and then you get the awesome meaty filling good lord they are divine we still haven t made it back for a sunday to try the shrimp with loofah soup dumplings hopefully soon
soups are amazing tried the chicken noodle vegetable and the hong king noodle ask for udon or thicker noodle great flavor great broth combination fried rice was on point definitely the go to after a long night out in vegas
i ve been meaning to leave a review for ru sans for the longest time and i have finally come to it i ve been going to ru sans for as long as i can remember it is one of the best places in the queen city to get sushi the rolls are amazing and that is what i go for the sashimi is good too and is always very fresh but i found another place called yama s that has more exotic sashimi and for eating sushi as long as i have i would have to say the more experienced sushi people that want some exotic sashimi notice how i am saying sashimi should go there their rolls are good too but ru sans rolls are better most of their rolls are very and i mean very flavorful the sauces they use are amazing and the service is very friendly a lot of times you can catch the owner working alongside the employees and that s pretty cool he is very friendly as well and hooks us up due to our <unk> of visits if all you re interested in is rolls or you re a beginner to sushi come to ru sans because they are definitely worth trying
yummy this place delivered to our hotel when we were staying at the hampton inn in henderson for a soccer tournament the food was amazing fast delivery and something for everyone
wow i m stunned at what a horrible experience i had here last time i went <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so much obviously there s no <unk> and serious managing problems our server was named <unk> she was one of the worst servers i ve ever had she was completely clueless on what her job was and is she finally came to our table minutes after we sat <unk> that s only because we asked the hostess to please find our server the restaurant wasn t busy at all either i ordered the mongolian beef with no green or red bell peppers i stated that to <unk> <unk> to the fact she didn t seem to be listening the first times i said it we also ordered eggrolls as an appetizer needless to <unk> came out at the same time as our meal my husband ordered the orange <unk> when it came <unk> just looked at each other and said what is this it was overcooked pieces of <unk> drowned in some <unk> brown sauce nothing like the last time we were here and of <unk> mongolian beef was covered in red and green bell peppers we had to ask for the manager joe who definitely should not be managing any restaurant this guy didn t know what to do we explained that this isn t how we ordered our food nor is it anything like the last time we ordered it a week previous he said well i guess it just depends on who s cooking today we sent the orange chicken back and had them re make it in the meantime i picked out all the bell peppers and ate part of my meal finally the orange chicken came back <unk> it wasn t much better than the first time other than there was a little less <unk> brown sauce on the plate the manager asked if it was better and we said not much but we ll eat it cause by now my husband was starving we kept trying to get our server to bring us sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard for the eggrolls she brought out with the <unk> finally a male server got it for us this server was horrible to say the least we had to track her down again to get our check so we could <unk> the other male server found her for us again i have no idea where she disappears to she said the manager wanted to give us a free piece of <unk> we got the chocolate cake to go i soooooo wish i would of opened the container and looked at it before we left i would of left it on the table we got home and opened the container and the server sliced off the frosting off the back edge of the cake and threw it in the container there was literally no cake at all just a slab of frosting that was old and disgusting so needless to <unk> m very hesitant on returning here the food and beverage manager needs to get a <unk> on these people he she is hiring the hostess is always <unk> she told us people complain about this server all the time so why do they keep her there then i m a <unk> i think i m going to skip this place a friend of ours went here and had a similar experience with the service and <unk> of food i wouldn t waste your money going here for the <unk> could go just about anywhere our meal was and the only thing that was decent was the eggrolls even the diet soda was disgusting there was no flavor just brown <unk> yuck the manager can t even adjust the settings on the soda machines he needs to go as well
it has been a while since i gave a restaurant five stars everything really has to come together the five stars rating is based on two visits six weeks apart initially after my first visit i though that perhaps it was the perfect spring arizona weather fluffy clouds light breeze the sunset sky with orange and purple <unk> that made the out door ambiance magical our next visit in the throws of the summer heat was just as magical the hostesses greeted us warmly on both occasions as did most of the staff as we walked towards our outdoor seats nothing in phoenix and i mean nothing compares to the outdoor seating here the candles the trees the <unk> the eclectic music the misters the hidden nook and crannies with hidden seating everything just works the menu is essentially fixed with a few choices of salads and main meals the wine list is excellent service is spot on and not intrusive the price point is high but well worth it the food obviously is star as my photos will attest to i can not wait for my third visit
service is friendly and the food is always impeccable but there s something about it being sort of like a fast food place in the middle of the fashion square that takes away what makes the other pita jungles in the valley special
ordered for delivery on the menu the have a bacon cheddar cheeseburger sub when it was selected it asked how would you like this cooked and medium was selected when the order was entered medium confused them instead of calling to alleviate the confusion they ordered bacon cheese fries and added additional charge so not only did i not get my cheeseburger sub but i was charged extra for something i didn t order when i called to explain the situation they were very receptive to getting a chicken bacon ranch sub out when the lunch rush <unk> down but i was a customer first and hour and a half later <unk> <unk> went my stomach they delivered a bacon cheeseburger sub i was extremely disappointed to say the least the only reason i gave stars and not is because alex was apologetic and is able to get my money back for the sub with out any argument
the peppermill never fails it s likely the best on the strip and probably in all of vegas the restaurant has the ambience of charlie murphy s hollywood stories with prince and rick james the fireside lounge is a more intimate setting it has a fire pit surrounded by lounge seating it s own bar and food menu every trip to vegas deserves a trip to the peppermill
umm how can i put this in <unk> i got the gyro and i could only stomach one bite the sauce was absolutely not authentic runny and nasty guess i should stick to <unk> s gyros
wow amazing food prices sauce s wow it s all good here soft tacos hard tacos quesadilla nachos loved it will always stop by it s my king taco in nevada
wahoo s is a fast casual chain serving bowls burritos tacos and enchiladas melding mexican brazilian and asian flavors i ll usually get their fish their tacos which they re known for and they usually don t disappoint i ve had no complaints with service with any of my visits the view separates this location from others as you can see both the summit of black mountain and you can can also have an <unk> view of the entire valley if you choose to sit at the bar or out on the patio weather <unk> the dining area is spacious with plenty of tables and some booths against the wall when you order you have the choice of protein for your dish which includes chicken carnitas carne asada fish shrimp and tofu the food is ok to me and on par with most <unk> and teriyaki bowl places with their fish tacos being worth return trips for everything else is a notch pricier to other establishments but not significantly elevated in flavor on this particular visit i had the carne asada outer reef burrito cheese lettuce rice beans green sauce with a side of salsa the steak was flavorful but i could have done without the lettuce if i m in the vicinity i d come back for some fish tacos or maybe to chill out in the bar or out on the patio with cerveza in hand
the fried chicken here was probably the best i ve ever had it s crunchy succulent flavorful every bite was heavenly the watermelon that came with the combo was great as well this is tucked away in the venetian on the bottom floor near the casino the inside of the restaurant was pretty big with an upscale casual vibe and cool decorations i would definitely come here again for the chicken
i left a review on google following an interaction with an employee and i have attached the response i got after <unk> the delivery hanging up i m also called a <unk> this is a very new form of customer service that i have never come across all the employee had to do was at least ask for confirmation call the service that i placed my order through and they would have figured out that it wasn t an error made by me this interaction that i have had with this restaurant is nothing less than comical i rarely review anything but this was so upsetting i had to do it the response i got shows exactly what it was i dealt with like i said never again
i ve been to joe s mr times and each time i m more impressed with their menu tonight i had the fish tacos they are by far the best fish tacos i have ever had and the corn on the cob side was amazing i m not a corn on the cob fan just had to give this place stars because food is exceptional especially for the price the background music makes your experience even better i could help but dance in my seat i hope joe s is around for a while
just discovered this place and i agree with the other rave reviews terrific place very friendly most excellent food and the prices are if anything much too cheap there is also a greek grocery attached also with great prices it s right next door to the <unk> hotel which is the best buy in mesa but don t tell anybody because i don t want it to become too crowded
nice and dark old school with the smell of garlic bread and a <unk> kitschy decor of a <unk> s apron with flair the place is oddly perfect for a romantic date night a family dinner that pleases everyone or a raucous party the endless wine helps the portions are huge and yummy my lasagna was so cheesy it was like queso <unk> with sauce my wife s cannelloni was a bucket of fresh ricotta wrapped in a pasta blanket my sister s sausage wasn t that a <unk> show was yum we ate for a long time and it looked like we never started make sure your room has a fridge and we ended up with uneaten garlic bread who doesn t finish off a basket of garlic bread i mean besides the lost boys oh and personally i m glad the endless wine isn t super awesome wine i don t like wine but this stuff was slightly watery and slightly flat so i was able to throw it down hey here comes gordy the accordion player he s like a mariachi band only it s one guy i understand the words and i don t shrink in my seat when he comes by keep a <unk> in your pocket to give him the guy will need a second hip soon the service is great too i didn t like much my minestrone soup it had like every vegetable in it i could point out so many it was like a richard <unk> book so i asked if i could get the salad mmm with a slice of salami instead no problem can we get more garlic bread sure please make room for a <unk> size basket of garlic bread hey since this wine is endless can i leave my car here please do would you like us to fill it with garlic bread oooh and that hot chocolatey cappuccino at the end w whipped cream nothing s better on a stomach full of pounds of cheese and a gallon of wine than some hot liquid chocolate coffee keep your leftovers so you have something to eat while you re in the bathroom
i received my yelp shout out on this restaurant and decided to give it a try after a bit of research i was excited about the menuso today was the day <unk> go when your in a hurry the restaurant was not that busy for lunch but it took longer than a usual wait to receive our order <unk> was well worth the wait <unk> i mean from the fried potatoes to the thai rice fish tacos to the chicken sandwich was awesome <unk> s to the chef <unk> i will make this a regular stop cause i want to try everything on the menu if i was to make a suggestion it would be to our waitress jamie talk more to your <unk> them tuned in on wait <unk> <unk> service friendliness and appreciation will go far thanks for <unk> customers a waitress a restaurant owner a real estate professional
this is a great place for wine and beer lovers they have something for everyone and dog friendly as well a must stop if you love hole in the wall places wait staff is very friendly and helpful
the food was spot on and was as good as hakka food i ve had in gta good size portions clean and spacious friendly staff and reasonable prices i couldn t ask for more stars only because i m not a fan of hakka style cuisine in general
portions are really big and that s good b c i always love the food i get here it s a fun place but i must say that i really dislike the line system it s just so inefficient but i guess that s part of the charm
this place is a breath of fresh air after all of the previous failures that have plagued this building ginger monkey sounds strange indeed and serves american fare which seems odd too our party of was seated promptly on a friday night with no reservation they have a decent beer list with local brews i ordered the meatloaf tray since it sounded fun and different it came with meatloaf mashed potatoes gravy a mocha brownie and creamed corn on a tv dinner tray points for not being boring the food was pretty good too although i wasn t a fan of the brownie the meatloaf was moist with a <unk> of ketchup the corn was creamy as it should be <unk> the potatoes were great with the gravy great comfort food every one else appeared to enjoy their food as well service was good too you have to check out the bathrooms too i ve never been on a heated seat toilet before lol definitely a great addition to chandler ginger monkey
great food and great prices we just went there for lunch and it was a fantastic dining experience the homemade vegetable soup was as good as you can get it was loaded with fresh veggies every salad dressing is homemade they put tons of feta cheese on the greek salads and the greek dressing is amazing i had the chicken souvlaki plate and it was so good the pita bread was locally baked the other person i was with had the marinated chicken tenders on rice once again muy delicioso the fried squash was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside the prices were equally as good for the chicken plate it came with a greek salad pita bread and one side of your choice for the marinated chicken tenders sides included both meals came with complimentary soup this was our first time dining there but we will be eating there again very soon
i placed an ordered through ubereats i ordered a create your own chicken wrap and received it with no chicken when i called the restaurant in hopes of getting the matter resolved i was told that i didn t pick chicken off of what i could add to the wrap however there is no option to add chicken unless you put it in the comments below who would think that was necessary at a chicken cafe on a create your own chicken wrap i did not get the option for them to fix it the lady basically told me it was my fault i paid more for a create your own veggie wrap than i would have paid for a chicken wrap never eating here again
a few friends love this spot so i finally checked it out the tacos were good i especially like the fresh tortillas i love the authentic tacos like tripas and lengua both were cooked very well the salsa bar was very limited not sure if it was due to them just opening when i got here i also tried a gordita which was not impressive it was more like an arepa but it had a lot of flour in the masa which made it gummy i will stick to the asada <unk> tripa and lengua tacos
we don t live around here but we re in the area so decided to try it out first the food was amazing the shrimp soft taco had the yummiest sauce and the carne asada soft taco was also delish one problem was that i asked for double beans instead of rice and when i drove away and opened my container there was rice bummer also the wait time was a little long but i was happy there was a drive through overall decent experience just annoyed about the rice
this is one of those things you simply must see in las vegas of the free experiences on the las vegas strip this is the best there are several songs that they rotate and the show takes place every minutes during the day and into the evening if you stay in one of the bellagio rooms facing the fountain you can listen to the music on your television stars for being amazing
this is my first time visiting mcdonald s located on <unk> road in charlotte north carolina this place is very clean and in great location in the shopping center the <unk> are efficient and work quickly to get your order i am disturbed by customers who use the app on the phone to make an order then are impatient because the data didn t come in before they walked in so the waitress couldn t process the order this customer walked out leaving the order she was the rude one i am completely satisfied with the service i received at this location
for my first breakfast in montreal i searched yelp for a location not too far from my hotel based on the stellar reviews i headed over to this cafe the wait to order was about minutes but being on vacation and not in a rush the wait didn t bother me so when i was finally able to order i ordered cafe au <unk> a bagel with cream cheese and a bagel with egg cheese and bacon the bagel with cream cheese came out just fine however the bagel for the bagel egg cheese and bacon was burnt literally black so i asked for another and that one was also burnt but more dark brown with a few areas of black as i don t like to complain i ate it picking off the black burnt parts of the bagel the egg cheese and bacon were all excellent but i m confused as to why my bagel was burnt twice my bill was for coffees and bagel sandwiches yelp let me down with this place the cafes were just ok
under new management with new mini donut station didn t get the chance to try this place before but happy with the current business they have about window seats and small table for there was constant flow of traffic so i was lucky to land the table i had the hot chocolate with roasted marshmallows with teddy graham crackers very tasty but also super sweet i ordered the thai iced tea soft serve with brownie bits and the flavouring wasn t very strong and generally didn t really impress me it also came in the cup which was a bit disappointing my friend had the cookie monster and it remains the crowd pleaser the ice cream amazingly didn t melt for a solid minutes we were literally in awe of the quality of the ice cream service was friendly and very quick despite how busy it was i tried pretty much all flavours of the mini donuts and my favourites were the pistachio lemon meringue s mores and maple walnut if you buy more than donuts it is tax free will definitely return to try some more ice cream or get the mini donuts as a gift but not the thai iced tea soft serve
this is a great lunch spot for a meeting that would benefit from other atmosphere conversation <unk> and topics lots of great unique things to look at inside the brisket is what tops this place off i get the brisket on a bun with fries and the assortment of different sauces to put on everything is fantastic keep up the good work
been there twice both times the food was good nothing to write home about but decently good the reason for the <unk> service wow talk about horrible service the first time we went we sat for about mins without our server even approaching our table we finally had to flag him down and ask him if we can put our order in the rest of the visit was more of the same us sitting and constantly flagging the server down for things we needed cause he never stop by on his own nd visit was more of the <unk> to ask multiple times for anything we wanted had to flag server down cause he never stop by our table my cousin had time to walk to <unk> and back before the server came to our table and take our order i don t think i will go back service just really sucked no one was rude or anything but being constantly ignored was not an enjoyable dining experience
we showed up at <unk> due to the great reviews on yelp the of us were seated quickly and had no problems fitting right in the crowd here was a mix of business meetings friends and people on dates on the tables were live cut your own rosemary and basil fantastic we ordered truffle mushroom risotto spicy <unk> taco montreal smoked meat sliders cheese fondue sausage apples salami penne <unk> meatball sliders this might seem like quite a bit for people but it really wasn t every thing came out appetizer sized and we shared the tables general opinion of the food ranged from amazing to good but not as the amazing sliders my favorite was their montreal smoked meat slider as you ve probably <unk> i ve had smoked meat sandwiches in famous delis in las vegas montreal and new york and i can honestly say these little sliders hold their own among the worlds best mounds of smoked meat on tasty little slider buns i was in heaven their fried shrimp sliders were also quite good wrapped in a soft tortilla the thumb sized fried shrimp were a nice crunchy comparison the only disappointment was the inhouse dessert it was an old tiramisu i don t know when it was made but definitely not fresh with a beer my portion pretty solid for what i got why stars <unk> has amazing food fantastic selection nice atmosphere good value for money why not stars weak dessert staff were only so so they really didn t know much about the food
best nihari in town real authentic taste reminded me of back home <unk> chicken is also good with their naan friendly staff definitely would recommend this place
i ve been here with my fianc many many times and more often than not we were the only customers in the restaurant during regular dinner hours the lack of customers both surprises and amazes me the food and the service are par for the course plus the restaurant is conveniently located near a subway and with pockets of residential areas behind it so there should be no reason why it is always so empty it s equally fascinating how the business has survived for this long for as long as i can recall this has been the case for the past years and i have no clue how <unk> maintains <unk> but of course that is none of my business so i will try to <unk> the reminder of this review talking about the food what can i say the food is good not earth <unk> so but definitely above common expectations i have ordered sushi noodles teppanyaki curry rice and everything is lovely it is on the pricier side and a person meal could easily go over so perhaps that s the reason behind its lack of popularity still if you ever want something slightly more refined than your local sushi take out place do give <unk> a try
to be honest this wasn t our st choice of buffets to try on our las vegas anniversary trip this time around we have been here before we wanted to try caesar s buffet but the line is so darn long plus our fault for going for dinner after not knowing buffets close so early so this particular night it was no different got here at waited a good minutes <unk> that we would get old food they reassured us that they will serve past it s not cheap that we can just blow away and eat old food this will be the only buffet we will hit just the of us sans kids and we can finally eat in peace and enjoy it but our fault for coming so late with that said we liked their selection first saw the crab legs but if you go down more there are different kinds of crab legs better ones by the salad area ahh they were good fresh cracked and really good with butter their cocktail shrimp and lamb chop was good too their sushi was fresh there wasn t much time to <unk> trying other useless typical buffet stuff and frankly their asian cuisine n won ton soup wasn t good at all but that s ok came here for seafood i remember their desserts were divine last time we came but bc of the late hour there wasn t much selection left their flan was good the last one we were lucky to get otherwise rest was so so yeah i do wish they have gelato instead of the soft serve strange that they don t our server was a nice asian lady n very kind and stopped by alot told us when to do the last calls and patient with us coming in so late just personally wish we had more time to enjoy our food instead of rushing and <unk> it all down did like the fact unlimited beverages came with it and coffee too overall enjoyed it crab legs were the best if it wasn t for m resorts buffet featuring their divine sashimi salad i would come back here next time
all i can say is its the best and there meat jun is my fav
this is solid food probably the best taco shop in this area and i have tried them all not the best location and probably could use use some atmosphere they could use a salsa bar also they take square payments now
best pizza i ve ever had i grew up in western pa with a lot of italian eateries around and this tastes like my childhood every time i visit home i make my mom and dad order this for me it s delicious thick sicilian squares with a robust <unk> and tons of fresh mozzarella you can order by the slice and so you can customize toppings for your slices it s marvelous
there really is no reason to eat anywhere else in vegas if you re filipino well if you re in the mood for filipino food that is you can eat wherever you want ok so this restaurant is a point and serve establishment <unk> cafeteria style aka <unk> <unk> so with that in mind make sure you try to sample everything you can t do vegas in a day and you definitely can t do dj s either my last time here i had <unk> and bangus it was pretty much off the chain i don t know what it is about taro leaves that brings out massive flavor you know what kills flavor the quality of the restrooms if you re not filipino then you probably won t understand what s happening on the television usually a game show or a soap opera is playing but more than likely a game show you will definitely leave this place full and relatively happy i advise you head back to your room immediately afterwards because the <unk> hits hard when you eat here find a bed fast
being from san diego it is hard to find a good taco place that compares but this place has the tj style taco down pack the service is fast and the staff is super friendly the owner is always there checking on the customers and is helpful friendly and a pleasure to talk to we have been coming here for awhile and have yet to be disappointed the al pastor is great and their fish tacos are even better we always recommend this place when people are looking for good mexican food in vegas we actually came across this place off the strip at the taco stand they had out there and have been hooked ever since five years later whenever we take a trip down to vegas we have to stop in and grab a few tacos
si vous <unk> vraiment les <unk> en hauteur ca vaut la peine de payer pour aller s <unk> pleine la vue de montreal <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> l expo sur les <unk> endroits <unk> mtl est pour les <unk> aucune surprise pour un vrai <unk> resto sur place et aussi terrasse pour un drink
if you are looking for an average inexpensive quick burger this is the place if you are looking for a great burger that makes you say wow you are in the wrong place i have no clue where all the hype comes from apparently there are many people who have never eaten a good burger to be able to make a comparison be sure to get a double as the patties are tiny service was fast friendly and efficient bun and fries were fresh
really good cheap food right on the strip this place has a great rueben sandwich and yes it s the same company as the famous one in la there s not a ton to say about this place it s nice and clean and serves good cheap food in large portions you order at the counter then they bring the food out to your table you get a little number i hate that style but it works so no complaints this place is a great hangover cure in vegas for a good price be warned it s very bright in the place it s kinda like a s kitchen style decor so it feels very bright and <unk> not recommend for a loud drunk definitely worth a whirl if you like deli food and fries
many places are defined by their patios victory cafe is one of those for most of the summer that is it is a well known venue for some art nights and their colour selection of beers on tap although not too many no one is going to confuse this place with <unk> or much less the bier market during the winter this is a great place specially the second floor with a large room to mingle and a fireplace however due to the large landing strip of a patio it will be of no surprise that during sunny days there will be a line up of people and yes most likely to use the patio or better said to avoid the dante s inferno roasting people alive inside the main building for real it is painfully hot i recently hosted a spanish language event and we were originally set to be in the small room to the left of the entrance on the main floor otherwise known as le oven only minutes after arriving i requested for my group to be moved to the main room yes it was also hot but at least it had one window remember the old saying in a world full of rooms with no windows the one room that has one is the one where no one <unk> in so we endured having fun and drinking and being merry all in all it was a lot of fun i ended up being there for hours and still left people there to carry the torch until they finished their food and drink or until they spontaneously <unk> whichever happened first the food was alright the prices are decent but during the summer if you want to go a patio come here if you can t get into the patio go elsewhere hopefully with some ac
as this was our fourth time going we already knew what to expect it was my husband and my year wedding anniversary and there was no other romantic place that we could choose from we are both vegan so we knew that we would be getting amazing food that was not the case the hostess asked if this was a special occasion and we did mention that it was our anniversary but there was no acknowledgement of our anniversary we were cool with that because we are a same sex couple and we understand how people may react we were also shocked how the bottle service was going to be which is more expensive than the bottle of wine they served that should have been our first sign of actually leaving when the waitress came up from she made a comment with a small attitude about so you call me up here for a two topper but there are multiple two topper which one is mine the waitress provided wonderful service but it didn t make up for the sub par quality of food the first entree the waitress went ahead and said you may have already had this which we did and i was already disappointed we know that the menu changes every couple of months and the last time we went was back in august nd entree was very disappointing as if the restaurant didn t know what to do so they just scrapped a couple of things together and served the third entree they used gardein products and i was extremely disappointed as prior time they were able to put together a meal and make it delicious and having us use are palette the fourth entree was ok as it wasn t anything to fancy the fifth entree was definitely a huge disappointment as the veggies were under cooked and the starch was over cooked and the fake meat once again came up again the dessert came and it was good the first and last dish was probably the only thing i real enjoyed at the restaurant upon paying my bill i was extremely shocked that the price went up another per person which i do understand that if it s a high demand restaurant that you gotta do what you gotta do but at least make the meal worth per person i don t think i will be coming back again
when looking for a place to treat a friend for brunch i remembered cornerstone i ve had it bookmarked for awhile but kept putting it off i would drool over the brunch menu but then would be turned off by some of the negative reviews regarding service but finally one beautiful sunday afternoon i took a seat at one of their outdoor tables to enjoy a great meal on a great day service was good until we tried to pay our bill and getting change for our cash seemed to be a challenge for the wait staff but refills were never a problem with our drinks and food was presented in a timely manner that being said i will most definitely recommend cornerstone for the brunch menu my friend enjoyed the porky pig and i devoured the potato benny both versions of eggs benedict i wouldn t hesitate to return for a lazy sunday brunch during warmer weather when i can enjoy the outside seating

not too bad a place to buy food vegetables arent always the freshest so it s hit or miss the food court is a decent place with few but good places to choose from good place to go if you have small kids too as its open and relatively clean
it s a saturday night you re not looking to drop a ton of cash but you want to go somewhere with great food and great atmosphere so many options but where should you go that place is <unk> kitchen i went here a few days ago when i walked in the place had a lively vibe it was pm and there were a ton of large parties having dinner it was a little loud but as people started leaving after the wine bottles were empty it was much quieter the waitress assigned to my table was very nice didn t hover too much but did come back to check on us periodically throughout the meal she also didn t rush us out of the table which was really great and relaxing the food was pretty solid i know everyone raves about the zucchini chips but i would put them at a solid ok the short rib pasta was the winner for sure not heavy like you would imagine a short rib dish to be but packed with flavor a must get chicken piccata was also light and a nice here is what you can find at <unk> kitchen mostly neighborhood people from their s and s so you re getting the i go out one night a week and this is it crowd who are enjoying some drinks with friends without acting ridiculous perfect if you re looking for a moderate priced restaurant for a group birthday party or a couples date where you won t fuss about splitting the check down the middle because the prices aren t outrageous
my family recently had lunch here and enjoyed it i tried the <unk> roll which is a veggie roll wrapped in chard in lieu of seaweed that was not indicated in the description so it was a surprise to me when it arrived at the table it was tasty though as was the miso soup my children shared the quinoa waffles what i did not enjoy was the mushroom tobanyaki the flavor was just not good to me and i felt like the dish was missing something perhaps serving it over rice to absorb some of the liquid would have been helpful service was good and we had several people check on us not just our waiter the reason i docked a star was the price i felt like everything was so overpriced i don t mind paying more for good quality and our food was of good quality but even with that in mind i still left feeling like it was just too overpriced and i left still a bit hungry lunch for adults and kids no dessert no drinks was
i love neighborhood establishments with a familiar family feel nova s definitely has that warm homemade bakery charm from the loaves of bread goodies in the case and cute cafe style seating i wanted to like nova s i ordered a chai tea latte and a cannoli the chai tea latte was nice with a stronger chai spice flavor than what you would find at dean and <unk> s the service was efficient and friendly but not with the same level of warmth as the decor might lead you to believe why i like neighborhood cafes is how the people who work there make you feel grateful of their patrons conversational kind patient and they pay attention to the details nova s bakery has that potential but during my brief visit during a lull point in the day the service and vibe was mediocre going through the <unk> without that personal touch the cannoli was pre filled so it didn t have the crispness that i prefer and the filling was a bit dried out compared to places like <unk> s in san <unk> ca it was far less tasty however maybe it was my mistake getting a cannoli at this bakery i m looking forward to giving nova s another try they had awesome looking breads and pastries perhaps next time i ll strike up a conversation and find out just what their <unk> are
food is really good i have been a few times now without the owner or staff knowing who i am i m <unk> not seeing great service i have been there when they are busy and not so busy staff was much more attentive the second time around i have been there times now it s all the little things like making sure we have utensils more drinks napkins checking up after we get our food things like that i guess my <unk> would be to order beers at the same time and be prepared to chill
good food but the service was slow vegetarian food was great it was nice seating and we got a table really quickly the waitresses were very <unk> it for all
this new taco bar cocktail bar <unk> brilliant when my girlfriend mentioned that we were headed to meet friends for dinner and we were going to taco y taco i imagined the normal small taco shack with great food as you would find at their other location with underwhelming decor i was overwhelmed when i entered taco y taco on eastern this place is big two levels with plenty of seating and you ll want to spend some time here it has a nice ambiance with cool modern chandelier lighting and dark accents it s a surprise that their tacos are still only we sat at the bar waiting for friends we had some happy hour beers and the bartenders were super nice once we got around to eating we went through the taco bar i had tacos one al pastor a carne and a carnitas my fave of the was the carnitas i wasn t overly impressed by the al pastor i ve definitely had better my gf had tripa lengua and an al pastor she seemed to enjoy them and had the same feelings about the al pastor this is definitely a great spot for something quick something slow and some late night dining enjoy
great little hole in the wall kinda spot the tacos are delicious and since it s all they serve you d expect them to be i ve eaten here about times and for me the steak sausage or just steak but why opt out of sausage <unk> vegetarian and fish tacos were the best note battered fish i d personally stay away from the chicken it s totally fine but not as good as the others i haven t tried the pork yet but i will on my next visit these are not the tiny little tacos you may ve gotten elsewhere one is enough for one person two if you re very very hungry i often go with a friend and share different flavours together tacos each is a nice big meal and you get to try different ones you can t argue with their low price point very reasonable and great to take out so you can eat them in a park in the summer or take them home to have with a cold lager they don t serve alcohol they have an array of mexican <unk> including mexican coke which is apparently prized among those who care about soda for being sweetened with sugar and not high fructose corn syrup like us coke pro tip the tacos usually have a second tortilla underneath ask for this one separately as they get very soggy from all the ingredients whether you re taking them out or staying in it s much more convenient to have the second tortilla s on the side so it doesn t get soggy helps you scoop up all the deliciousness d
awesome place for groups we in ours and took full advantage of the family style special they had basically it s a massive place with a mixture of pork specialties ribs chops shanks <unk> with fries roasted veggies all great stuff some of us had other items on the menu all of which were great and the portions are huge so be ready for the meat sweats when your done i added a few photos especially of the massive meat family plates i d highly recommend this place the prices were good service was excellent it s located in a small enough local that s very well decorated then again it s in the village would you expect anything less
the food and prices are great but the service is horrendous and consistently so we ve gone here many times and the service is always bad you get seated right away but are out of luck if you need to ever need something the waiters and waitresses constantly walk by but they won t make eye contact i ordered some sushi rolls off the menu and never received them it took minutes after asking several waitresses the waitress brought out more than i ordered and said i wouldn t have to pay for it when we got the bill she had charged us for the rolls i never asked for we even asked several waitresses about the rolls and everyone seemed to have forgotten about them after terrible neglectful service every time we finally are giving up on going here ever again
best food best hospitality must visit in toronto don t miss <unk> oh man real food orgasm
this place is overall fantastic there is a hip diner atmosphere the servers are always very attentive and there are so many options for food there are several vegetarian and vegan options for both breakfast and lunch dinner if you are or aren t a vegetarian try the vegetarian hash or the meatless loaf of the gods both are insanely tasty and huge
surprisingly not bad convenient location ample parking the food is good and the turnaround time is decent i have to admit that i was there on sunday afternoon and not sure of how it is on a weekday one area where it could be improved is more detailed menu you almost have to read the printed menu before ordering
i don t know where to start my review came with my husband for brunch and had to wait min for a table more than enough time to see how the kitchen runs service is slow and food didn t come at a regular pace the fridge at the back <unk> a number of no name brand containers where <unk> dairy products are stored from margarine to creams i suspected those were used as containers i was able to confirm it wasn t real dairy when my buttermilk pancakes arrived with some edible oil topping instead of butter couldn t taste the buttermilk flavor either and the blueberries weren t bleeding which made me think we re frozen no name brand blueberries i have to say this happened min later because as i mentioned before service was very slow and mediocre not even asking how we liked our food hubby attempted to eat eggs with an hollandaise sauce that had a vinegary after taste he then tried to eat the homemade fries lukewarm and cooked only on one side with so called caramelized onions wanted to try a place with good reviews on this side of the city but this is not the place to go in case my review isn t clear i do not plan to come back to this place that cuts corners and their only good reviews are for the exposed brick wall
early in our relationship belle <unk> to me that she didn t like tacos or meatloaf this was of course a serious problem some homemade pulled pork tacos later one of the <unk> was cleared but the meatloaf issue continued to <unk> me enter avenue b first off don t let the largely unfinished web site turn you off avenue b has a much more expansive menu that what you ll find online thankfully the above mentioned meatloaf is a mainstay although its exact composition changes seasonally you ll find starters and entrees on the chalk board menu most of which are made to one degree or another to highlight local and seasonal fare quick aside assuming you remember your own wine this is a pretty good place in terms of menu and atmosphere for a date just know that they don t give you menus you have to rely on the <unk> not every seat has a great <unk> to the boards so don t make your date sit in a chair so she has to awkwardly crane her neck to figure out what she wants to eat and for god s sake don t as i did forget your glasses and resort to having your date read to you belle was understanding but for an early date i was hoping to come across as something other than quasi <unk> all the meals i ve had at avenue b have been very good the cook obviously knows what he s doing his previous spot the red room really took off under his guidance that said the menu is not going to blow anyone s mind when it comes to pushing the <unk> with unusual preparations and or ingredients take a closer look at the menu picture from the yelp profile and you ll see roast chicken braised short ribs ny strip steak falafel and tabouleh seared scallops bbq not pictured but also on the menu fish and chips meatloaf not really very vegetarian friendly and not really separating itself from the crowd there are of course excellent reasons from a financial standpoint to play it safe when it comes to pittsburgh menus but i think the city s tastes are slowly changing and i hope avenue b steers its obvious skill in more interesting directions down the line all that said if you like these things and i certainly do avenue b does an excellent job with them on visit i ordered the meatloaf and loved it it was probably the best meatloaf i ve ever had with apologies to my father after much <unk> i convinced belle to have a bite on our most recent visit belle ordered the meatloaf for herself which stands as <unk> to how well avenue b executes the new american bistro catalog
first of all how can you not love subway they are convenient fresh and quick and the food is always good i went in the other day and <unk> was amazing she was so pleasant and it really put me in a great mood i have been on a health kick lately and she recommended adding spinach to my sandwich which was just what i needed i would much rather eat spinach on a sandwich then have to eat a salad i really got the vibe that she actually cared about what i wanted i left as a happy customer
of the vegeterian places i ve tried in montreal this is one is definitely one of the ones on the top of my list i m especially in love with the hemp burger sadly that also means i have not wanted to order anything else yet
this place has an amazing fish fry and awesome reuben egg rolls the food is classic irish deliciousness on the weekends they have live irish music but get there <unk> seating fills up fast
really good have heard bad reviews from others but upon visiting my first time the chicken was great and the staff was super friendly when the girl brought out our food i mentioned that the soda machine spout for ice tea was only <unk> water she fixed it right away and let me know they were out of many salsas too and they sincerely apologized will come back for more amazing chicken
there are few restaurants that i have been to while drunk that have been so unimpressive my wife and i decided to try this place just to see what guy s food was like we walked in and were not greeted but watched the hostess fold t shirts once she recognized we were there she began to help but took about a minute to gossip with a co worker about how guy s kids were on the patio poor service once we were sat we we simultaneously over and underwhelmed by the good on the menu i ordered a local beer actually this place has a decent list considering it s location we ordered buffalo potato things that came with wasabi buffalo sauce seemed right on par with what we expected my wife wanted a glass of wine but they were sold out of <unk> how do you sell out of wine all in all this place gets stars for local beer and a nice while overworked waitress i would never go here again
wowza this place could probably convert a texas rancher to a vegan the food is that good i started with a yummy salad greens with balsamic dried figs pecans strawberry the small salad was a very good size then had the apricot miso rice bowl with tons of veggie mock chicken incredible sauce i would have licked the bowl had the restaraunt not been full speaking of full even though i was full at that point i could not pass up the soy <unk> had a ginger snap damn if i did not eat all glorious ounces of it my belly is <unk> it was worth it good thing i was wearing my platform <unk> shoes when i showed up this place is for young hipsters the vibe is young cool things i am not but not in a snobby way more grungy hip if ya know what i mean
pm they ran of <unk> all the way for nothing worst noodle shop ever i recommend to call them before just in case to make sure they still have noddles
best indian food i have ever had special ingredient used is love of uncle and aunty
if you have not tried mexican corn you just have to it s so good i m not sure if they give you the cup option here but you can use a knife anyway and cut it i have been here several times and the food was not too bad there are different lines for different meats but the wait isn t ever too long unless there s a special going on the service is not the best though when i walk to place an order most of the time the staff seems to not want it to bother them there were no smiles or greetings when it was time to pay i was the last in line
talk freshness to me ay <unk> eh might be compact in size but it packs a lot of freshness and flavour in each bite service here is outstanding and the food is superb they bring you a basket of fresh chips to munch on while you re waiting for your meal the place is decked out in d cor that <unk> <unk> you to mexico each bite of food you take is better than the last and you re almost always sad when it s over the lunch rush can be a bit nuts but they re always super apologetic for the inconvenience whether you just want to drop in for a quick bite order take out or want to enjoy a few <unk> over a couple of fresh fish tacos ay <unk> eh offers something for everyone
the food was so good it s insane that their lunch combo includes a chicken skewer a gyoza salad and miso soup everything tasted awesome i ordered curry with chicken katsu so good d
not the best but not the worst ordered the laksa soup base but i find the portion is bit small the chicken wings were great tho and the drink
fun ambiance with a hipster vibe very slow service at the counter should consider having waiters lots of workers but feels very disorganized as we waited they brought little delicious bites of cereals and then bread pudding the food is amazing everyone working here is great they just need to invest in a better way to serve their customers they did mention that they will be expanding which will be very helpful printing more menus would be a simple improvement will definitely come again the ingredients presentation and taste are wonderful
walked by here the previous day and the place was packed with a line out the door we figured it must be good i made a reservation for the next day we arrived and had to wait for a few minutes while they cleared the table had great seats by the window then the wait came we received a glass of water and then waited we seen the server buzzing around but evidently we were invisible finally she came by and i wanted a margarita went for strawberry on the rocks it was very sweet and hard to explain the taste not very good but drinkable i went for loaded steak tacos ok this made up for other things they were very good and all the toppings were fresh the guacamole was very good service did improve but the evening could have been better
food our group of seven ordered seven total rolls and three appetizers the appetizers were free with a large beer purchase we had edamame calamari and spring rolls the calamari was crisp and mixed with fried jalape o peppers the sauce compliments the fried calamari extremely well the spring rolls were very crisp and very fresh for our main course we ordered a variety of sushi rolls all were very good with the exception of one of their specials the case blanca contained great amounts of fish but the sauce did not compliment well it left an odd taste on our pallets the rainbow roll soft shell crab spicy tuna and baked scallop rolls were our tables favorites all are unique in flavor but contain extremely fresh fish we will certainly order all again and recommend ordering service the service was terrific our waitress had great advice and pointed out several cost saving tricks while ordering she had great knowledge and was completely on top of all our tables needs the sushi came out quickly and all of the food was well timed ambience the restaurant is small and very loud it was packed on a wednesday night recommend for small groups with only a dozen tables it will not accommodate large groups well the metal roof leads to a lot of noise it was ver hard to have a conversation in the restaurant with sushi restaurants on every block sakana holds its own the quality and prices are great
great food and service it s just like most hard rocks with the gift shop and all of the rock and roll memorabilia
this is the first time i came to this location i have been to their other ones before but this one is much bigger than the others on first glance it looked brand new with bright interiors when we placed our order we saw that the person who took our order did not wash his hands before making our chicken shawarma yuck he also put onions in our shawarma when we specifically asked to not put that in overall the prices were fair the food was okay and the portions were average i might visit this location again as it is very convenient and their prices are okay
i have been to another one of these in northern california and i have to say i was disappointed in my steak it was charred on the outside and i couldn t cut it with my fork like i normally can not a good place to check out in vegas i would try another steakhouse
i was in lv for a girls weekend and we decided to hit up sushisamba on saturday night the atmosphere was greatthe food was incredible and our server tanice was fun and so accommodating we decided to have the chefs prepare dishes for <unk> one of the girls is gluten free so most of our courses were <unk> the ones that weren t they made a special dish just for her they also have a giant selection of <unk> ordered a couple of bottles i would definitely go there <unk> for <unk> s the best
this is one of my favorite breakfast places i think the food is amazing and menu options are very creative i do hate the long wait do try their coffee cake and delicious omelettes i give this place stars for creativity and food
first i d like to give a shout out to my man dan at melt for being an awesome server guy and dealing with our rowdy group the food was awesome tastes great the next day too but the service is definitely what brings people back we went to melt late on a monday night and apparently it was a strangely empty night no wait was necessary but i have heard the stories of the three hour waits i wouldn t be down for that what a great idea a restaurant serving grilled cheese and almost nothing else yes there are burgers and other things if you aren t feeling cheesy
went in this morning for a toasted bagel and it took mins they just opened for the morning i walked back to the pick up window and they just kept running it thru with the result my bagel never toasted and i did not get a treat after i brought it up manager was watching the whole event
t today is rather disappointing first of all the waiters cannot follow the order the soup is the most uncomfortable food i have ever eaten i do not believe in their soup and they are tired of eating like the taste of the flavoring seasoning with many additives so even after i finished eating i was thirsty and i felt uncomfortable it wasn t really a soup i had made will not go out d <unk> les serveurs ne peuvent pas <unk> la commande la soupe est la nourriture la plus <unk> que j ai jamais mang e je ne crois pas leur soupe et ils sont <unk> s de manger comme le go t de l umami avec de <unk> <unk> donc m me apr s avoir fini de manger j avais <unk> et je me <unk> mal l <unk> ce n tait pas vraiment une soupe que j avais <unk> je n y vais pas
i love greek salad from showmars but i will never return to this one the male server pushed passed use to hold open the for a white female to leave as we was coming in when he return to take our order he rolled his eyes smack his lips i quote what do you want the other team members look shocked and upset at his actions and manner they looked at us like they where sorry i will never return
i came here for a birthday dinner and it was one of my first times trying filipino food the staff were great at recommending drinks i had their house punch which was delicious the food is served tapas style so portions are small we split dishes for people drinks dessert and we came out pretty full the stand outs for food were the garlic fried rice and crispy pork belly
imagine another negative review for this location the curly fries were cold the diet coke was flat and the ad i am subjected to times a day was not honored at this location companies should hire someone to read the reviews and address the issues needless to say my poor gf didn t want get forced in to combo meals so she opted to just get an order of fries well it was unfair and when i realized the she did not one i threw mine in the trash i will never know if they are any good because i will not go back now we are going to drive over to gyro time on charleston and go where we know we will get what is advertised and at a fair price
love the food here it s really nice to be able to have a great gluten free spot that other people who aren t gluten free still think is tasty in addition to gluten free i m also dairy free and the servers are pretty informed about my options ways to modify things and if they don t know for sure they always ask one star off because i don t really like the physical <unk> crowded seats are not very comfortable for someone with back neck problems like me unless you luck out and get a half booth and it does not ever seem very clean to me
not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point my girlfriend and i had dinner there last night with reservations set for pm were seated by our server william was awesome was fast attentative and really was one of the best servers we ve encountered and we dine out a lot we both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh hot and delicious i do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had buckets each so it <unk> to bucks a pound the only negative i did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of <unk> <unk> so being outside may be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top i just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable my girlfriend and i will definitely be returning to pickle bills we had a fantastic evening last thing to note the service was great even though the place was packed
thank you anthony bourdain i get this place i am now a fan for life
this is the best pizza i have had here in vegas the chicago style pizza was very true to chicago i am now a loyal customer

i am visiting my parents in toronto and they live around the area it s a pleasant surprise to discover this nice little restaurant on yonge i had a smoked salmon crepe and a sweet potato latte it was the first time i heard of sweet potato latte i wouldn t say it s my favorite but i think it s an interesting idea i didn t find it in san francisco bay area which is where i live the smoked salmon was tasty people may find it on the salty side but for me it s very good i would definitely come back in the future and check out their desert crepe i hope it s as good as what i had
oh my gosh this place i visited po boys today in celebration of my birthday after hearing rave reviews from a friend and looking up yelp reviews goodbye captain d s from the fresh fish display to the genuinely nice helpful staff i could not have asked for a more perfect bday lunch flounder was outstanding i ordered a oyster po boy to go for dinner sauces and sides really good the fried pork rinds came to our table still crackling on the plate what i will visit this establishment weekly for my seafood fix give this restaurant ur business they re earning it
this is a pathetic place to order food i would recommend everyone to think twice before going
we came in an hour before they closed on a sunday night we ordered about rolls and splitting the checks between people was pretty difficult since it was hard to put the right items in the checks the server re did the checks about three times and was very patient with us and didn t seem annoyed at all even when we made it difficult and we all appreciated her for it the rolls were very delicious and the price was pretty fair if you get a sake bomb you can get an appetizer for half off we all left satisfied and very full over all a great time at this restaurant
this is where you come for real ny style pizza the owners mike and tony are brothers from ny they originally opened their restaurant twenty years ago in the same shopping plaza they are currently in over the years word got around about their great food and personal service and they <unk> the size of the place last year they moved into a space more than twice the size of the previous location it has two separate dining areas as well as two rooms that can be reserved for private parties school class outings or sport team parties their prices are very reasonable and they serve wine spirits a nice selection of draft beer and fountain drinks the table service is great mike and tony also make an effort to greet and ask they name of their guests when they arrive which you will find no where else i wouldn t be surprised if their mom told them they should do this a long time ago and these two ny boys said yes mom if you want great food great service at a great value you go to casanova brothers pizza
california thai is in the toronto life square food court above future shop and the outlet beside it called caribbean queen or something are clearly the same food though they do try to hide it one side ct has green t shirts and black hats and the other caribbean has orange t shirts and white hats or is it the other way around anyway they both employ pleasant young chinese girls to serve the food after reading the other reviews i hesitate to admit that i enjoy the food there i usually go to the ct side because they have the tofu and eggplant as a veg so i have maybe the chicken or whatever else strikes my fancy with the tofu as a veg and pad thai noodles total cant beat that for generous portions
years i ve been here and finally checked this place out wasn t disappointed great lounge for relaxed <unk> nice mood set by the neon fire pits were a nice touch drink prices were good friendly waitress will have to check out the food next time
yummy traditional style asian desserts i tried a creamy mango dessert with coconut milk and a red bean sago both were not overly sweet and tasted fresh and healthier than a traditional dessert service was quick and the place was quite busy with others eating and chatting
stopped by before the hockey <unk> from mass was a great bartender great place to start your night
been coming here for months now look and pick what they had but just yesterday they changed the whole thing there s menus and now you can build your own poke bowl i like that they make things to order now but because of that it takes longer to get the food it used to be ask pack pay go i don t know if i like this new set up and new thing and it didn t look like they had exactly what they used to have on display before they took things out
i ve been wanting to try this facility out and for fathers day my wife and son set an hour session up online we arrived to a big line waiting on the stairs to get in to be told we had to buy a lifetime membership i thought that was odd we waited for an hour and the other feature is they want your driving license which they claim makes it easy to populate your membership into the computer not convinced about that once we were signed in we went to a third level bay the hostess ran through the basics too quickly but we figured it out it was a lot of fun and a clever use of technology to track your shots we ordered some basic brunch items which were fresh hot and tasty cocktails are expensive beer not bad my wife thought it was per person before noon but that was hr in the bay good value actually we had fun and even being outside in june the mister fans worked really well to keep you cool all in all a great experience we will go back in the evening and maybe they will get stars good job so far <unk>
archie s thai cafe is a great spot for a quick and filling lunch special or dinner for the nights that you don t feel like cooking we have handful of beautiful and elevated thai restaurants <unk> las <unk> you are looking for a perfect spot to impress your date or elegant ambience don t come here service has been always quick and <unk> find this unusual for asain restaurants there are plenty of spaces to accommodate small or large groups my favorite has become the only thing for me to order yen ta fo it s a big bowl of soup with thick rice noodles green vegetable fish ball fish cake fried tofu and of course seafood it s spicy and tons of flavor whenever i crave for noodle soup this is always on top of the list lunch specials are very affordable with soup small salad and choice of your <unk> and easy choice it is located right next to village square theater so you will never go hungry before or after a <unk> on the same block with <unk> and <unk> buldogi s food is not so exciting because it is always predictable couple of times i had orders to go and i ended up coming back with a wrong order so check your orders before you leave review
we had the panang curry with salmon and the <unk> steamed w papaya salad it was all so good first and probably last thai restaurant i ll eat at in vegas staff was great and service was very fast thank you lucky thai for the excellent meal and service
we weren t really impressed the service was fine but the pizza wasn t very good we got the margharita and the basil was all wilty and dry we probably won t go back even though we live within walking distance as there are better pizza places in town
great little pub in the old port awesome selection of beer and delicious original menu the only thing is the place is a little small and get s very warm but definitely would recommend
i love this place my gf and i split the big one burger fries and wings affordable and i get to make my burger the way i want it with the condiment bar wagon very cool that you can see the grill and i enjoy the laid back atmosphere bar is optional and they do have the newer style coke machine which is a nice option if you drink soft drinks the wings are some of the best in the valley zipps are my favorite so you get a gist of what type of wings i like the ranch here is the real deal as well which makes a difference not bottled or bagged ranch like many of the restaurants use the only issue i have here is that the burgers are cooked well done xtra well my visit yesterday but still are great because of the <unk> flavor i usually order my burgers rare to medium rare don t have that option here so i d rather get a burger at fuddruckers but the fries are better here and the wings and other sides are great options that separate ohw from other restaurants we had fried zucchini and fried mushrooms as well because my gf s parents ordered them everything was more than satisfying and we all had a great dinner worth a shot for sure the restaurant has been here phoenix metro long before many of us have
so far best buffet compared to paris and treasure island huge assortment of very fresh food tried most and everything was good the place is very clean they are always cleaning around the stations service is excellent and you can drink all the beer wine etc you can drink the price is very reasonable loved the seafood and fajitas paris on the other hand is overpriced and food stations not kept up i had to ask many times to have the food filled the food did not seem fresh food stations at <unk> as for treasure island the food was good place clean but very few selections
came here about two years ago when the first open and now we re back they re super nice people da kine you know busting out all kine samples for make your taste buds all krazy then you end up buying all kine smoke fish sausage cookies from uk russia i think all over europe go try um out
this is my favorite poker room in las vegas the chairs are oversized and comfortable you can get premium <unk> comped aka grey goose patron bombay the tournament <unk> they have are fantastic and you can sit down at one there daily no <unk> <unk> and if you hit the final table to hours have passed of true <unk> the rest of the venetian is beautiful as well and i would love to stay here at some point they got a bunch of high end dining and shopping as well all in all i love playing poker here and will always swing by when i m in town
stars the food was reasonably priced but i wasn t a big fan of their signature plate the fish tacos there was a good deal on beers the night that we went wednesday and the service overall was pretty good i feel there are better options out there but is worth a visit to watch a game once in a while
i went during lunchtime with a coworker and even though it s a counter where you walk up to order the service was a little rude and surprisingly slow the girl at the counter basically ignored us after we decided what we wanted and then she was brusque when she took our orders it took a long time to get our noodles and order of fried pickles and since it was lunchtime and we had to get back to work that s a bit problematic the fried pickles were good and the noodles were okay but a little bland my coworker liked his but said it wasn t great just fairly good i doubt i ll return for more even though i work within walking distance
wonderful italian beef sandwich loved the minestrone soup friendly atmosphere and waitresses was cute as a button
this is an ideal place on the strip when you are craving some legit chinese noodle soup either for drunk munchies since they are open late or for a hangover cure by legit i mean all the staff tha works here are chinese including the cooks i had the beef noodle stew which came with preserved cabbage and large chunks of beef some dense feeling hand tossed noodles and a really really good broth base perfect for hangovers my girl had the preserved egg and pork porridge it tasted almost as legit as my mom s we shared the bok choy with oyster sauce which was perfectly boiled the only thing is that this place is pretty expensive our bill was almost fifty dollars for what would cost only fifteen to twenty in chinatown somewhere but keep in mind you are eating in the venetian <unk> large portions so share
this place is frustrating it s not really a great sports grill tv set up is just really subpar and many of them aren t on hd that said happy hour specials are good the patio is great with misters fans a <unk> and cool furniture the wings are great you can get a half pound of them on hh for no paper towels in men s room air dry only yuck subpar tvs esp at bar not hd properly aligned too small only for bar all tvs waaaaaay too small very small beer glasses if you pay full price for appetizers you re a fool small portions and expensive
i got the vegas wrap and my boyfriend got the flaming dragon wrap both delish and they have gluten free soy sauce
undoubtedly the best indian restaurant in the valley their very talented chef <unk> formerly executive chef at <unk> restaurant will create incredible dishes to satisfy your <unk> i particularly love their shrimp tika lamb masala and lamb chops or for a light lunch the shrimp mango <unk> a must if you live in the valley or visiting

my wife and i went to bld in chandler the food was not good no flavor no love could have done much better although the service was good
the food was good the service was horrendous our waitress <unk> literally kept forgetting about us took forever to even come to our table to take our drink order by time she arrived we knew what we wanted to eat we asked for a drink menu yet another long wait ordered our drinks another long weight asked us if we wanted dessert twice i m literally writing this as i wait for our check it s that bad
was a good place to go until you get your stuff stolen girlfriend had her wallet stolen a few months ago then i set my phone down on the bar and someone stole that if you go don t bring your valuables with you
all these reviews don t lie this place is killer let s just say if anyone comes here and says they don t like it or it s just <unk> t trust their taste buds or reviews anymore p they have a variety of flavors that change daily and some of them sound really strange flavors like pear blue cheese avocado and cucumber ginger sound weird but venture out and try them everyone here is super nice and genuinely seems excited to describe and let you sample different flavors one of our favorites is the chocolate sorbetto <unk> which is just downright amazing mix that with one of the gelato s and you will not be disappointed we also got a cupcake there and it was one of the best i ever had ridiculously good chocolate flavor and super moist i tried to think of anything negative that would warrant stars but i just can t the gelato is amazing their customer service is beyond top notch and the prices are crazy good for the location it is a little bit tricky to get to and the parking isn t the greatest but who cares it s worth it
came here again and i still love this place this is where i come to be a <unk> after a long night of drinking awesome service never a long wait for a table or food and food is awesome and portions is more then enough
awesome small plates tuna and baja ceviche queso fundido wagyu beef and watercress salad dinner is even better with gaucho steak ribeye we sat at the bar and tanya was absolutely fantastic server bartender i would very much recommend border grill
i love wildflower and all your new fall options frank went above and beyond helping us decide on what new menu items to try based on what we usually get he was so nice double checked everything in our order to make sure we weren t leaving without anything i just wish there was another location in old town scottsdale but i will always come back to this one
just got a bagel with expired strawberry cream cheese it smells awful i don t know how they wouldn t have known super disappointed i ve called several times and no one will answer either
awful service was bad the food was bad it took so long to get service he finally came so we ordered it took forever to get our food and then once the server brought our food he never came back we tried flagging other servers down but they didn t pay any attention i asked for over easy eggs and got over her eggs that i couldn t even cut sent them back and they brought some more that were the same way the iced coffee was like flavored milk we talked to management and they didn t seem care all we received was a cold apology i guess i would be upset too if i was a manager bussing tables won t be going here again
wow this is what home made tastes like from the moment we opened the door <unk> they moment we walked out we were family the service <unk> just friendly it was very good i had the baked ravioli and wifey had the alfredo from the first bite of each dish you can taste that everything is home made right away i was pleased with the pricing and how laid back it was for this quality of food they are not trying to be fancy i feel they are just happy to serve delicous food the most delicous dish of the dinner was the tiramisu i dont even like tiramisu but this was incredible i asked myself why this resteraunt doesn t have more reviews and the only reason i can come up with is that the most of the customers were a little bit older not sure but you have to give this a try
first time here week gotta say the service award a little slow took a while to get our food and hen the order was wrong once the food arrived it was pretty damn good food tasted fresh
this was the biggest pleasant surprise of my trip to vegas ebc turned out to be an amazing day club i was a guest at encore so i purchased tickets through the concierge to skip the line which was a huge life saver the line was easily over an hour long so being able to walk right in saved a lot of time i arrived at and saw djs before dillon francis came on and everyone was great played good party music and got the crowd going dillon francis came on around and was better than anticipated there was never a line for the bathrooms and a very short line at the bar sure the big drinks in the novelty cups are expensive but they free pour the liquor and are very strong well worth the cost the atmosphere here is a lot of fun without being trashy and i didn t have to worry about my flip flops etc being stolen lost like i did at wet republic if you have to choose between ebc and wet republic definitely come here i can t wait to come back
amazing driving through and have been wanting to visit here for some time i had crab legs just so delish btw great deals on monday and tuesday for crab legs if they are your thing hubby had spare ribs he loved them dry rubbed smoked and lean happy hour on sunday all day casual atmosphere so perfect for our trip through this becomes a place to get to madison for we must start planning our next trip back
just an <unk> received a message from bravo regarding my recent experience they asked that i send them my email address to my surprise they sent me a e gift certificate i thought that was a nice <unk> ll be sure to use it
we stopped at this place for the first time and it was really welcoming and cute great place for casual small groups not very many tables but we got there at pm and managed to get a table there was a line around pm on a friday they also give free chips while you re waiting with salsa the salsas didn t have a very strong flavour but just different levels of spicy we ordered tacos carnitas beef brisket and haddock all were delicious the haddock was very light beef was very soft and carnitas was very well flavoured it was a little small though so would suggest ordering something else we also got a carnitas burrito it tasted good but it was difficult to taste everything in it it would have also been nice if water was complimentary water only came in bottles overall great experience very reasonably priced and would come back again
do you like applebee s this is mexican applebee s <unk> will eat and rave about pretty much anything it seems
love korean food love hotdogs this is it they re the one and only korean fusion hotdog restaurant in town it s just so good my favorite is angry kimchi hotdog and sweet potato kimchi fries it s got fried kimchi and pork in it they also have other good ones like gangnam hotdog me and my buddies each ordered one hotdog and shared one carne asada fries and it was just enough to make all of us full i would definitely go back and try other food on the menu
stopped in for some yummy goodness the nibbles were awesome but we got there later in the afternoon and they were out of a lot of choices
not worth the prices they charge food was ok service was mediocre decor was average this restaurant wont last long with the way it currently is shame
came in to watch the asu game and sat at the bar jessica was our bartender and was awesome great chips and guacamole and drinks
lots of good food eggcellent breakfast they use pamela s mix for the gluten free pancakes i didn t find the pancakes as tasteful <unk> other places but ok nonetheless
i love jamaican food my first true discovery of this casual and cool food was from pearl who would cook up plantain and beans and rice and ackee and <unk> for breakfast one of my favourite ways of having breakfast really solid food for jamaican and i think the best was the ox tail ya gotta try it my <unk> s really enjoyed it and especially since it was their first time having jamaican food i was sooooo happy they likey
st time going to scooters yesterday after waiting almost minutes to order a drink i had to ask times after giving the bartender my order for a drink to please get it for me she kept forgetting finally the food server got it for me the service was extremely slow food was fair was really bummed because i was expecting more after reading the reviews by others before me will not be returning on to <unk> <unk>
short review worst possible experience after an impromptu first visit at this restaurant which replaced the boston steakhouse at the intersection between <unk> and sheppard the story walked in with my sister for lunch after seeing that there was a new pho place in the neighbourhood the bad from the get go our experience was a negative one since we were asked to sit at a table that wasn t even cleaned from the previous guests despite having multiple tables that were free and already set up we ordered the lamb chop meal with a cold milk tea and the curry chicken lunch special with a hot milk tea which included a free soup and a hot drink per order the waiter did not bring up the fact that the cold drink would include an extra when the waiter cleared the table after our order she basically dropped the eating utensils on the table butter knife spoon fork without a napkin to <unk> the contact between the utensils and table the soup that came first was very salty but passable due to the buns that came with it the lamb chop came for my sister and she immediately noticed two things the cut was two entire cuts of fatty meat and the meat was completely raw despite asking for a medium rare which our server ordered as a the lamb chop was remade still a fatty cut but much more lean meat in comparison to the previous cut this was super salty as well when my curry chicken arrived this was really salty as well to the point that half my rice which was a small bowls worth was finished after having only eaten pieces of curry chicken no more than of the curry chicken dish was consumed before we decided to just pay the bill and leave our drinks did not arrive until after we asked for the bill which itself took a long time to arrive when we pointed out why there was an extra on our bill the waiter said it was due to the cold drink very rudely pointing to the bottom of a separate menu we did not look at they had different menus by this point we just wanted to leave so we paid the bill and left the good we pointed out that the lamb chop was overly raw to a separate lady who seemed like the manager and she immediately apologized and told us that a for lamb chops is usually inedible and that people usually order upwards of she offered to remake the order for us conclusion horrible service experience overly salty food and soup curry chicken lamb chop vegetable stew manager was nice will not be returning
probably should give star if that sadly i ve had more messed up orders at this particular fast food establishment than anywhere else ever they are so incompetent here from everyone up to management just there last week after swearing i d never go back and i was the only person inside the restaurant at pm i tried their new kiosk thing for the first time annoying then stood at the counter for close to minutes while i was ignored by everyone including the manager while they continued to take and complete all the drive thru orders <unk> m a paying customer too why must i stand around waiting <unk> also the manager fills her time while making customers wait by typing on her laptop with the gloves on they use to make food and to keep things sanitary wanna bet she types on that with her plain old dirty hands too then compromising the clean gloves when making food this place was also really dirty especially the drink machines yet the staff has time to stand around looking bored and not preparing my food sadly all these idiots will now get even higher pay next year thanks to those who voted for a minimum wage increase these guys don t even earn what they get paid now no less more in the future
finally got back to the avenue club for dinner it has become a new and classy place the four busy bartenders are encouraging the high end drinks by presenting you with a place setting with all the speciality drinks pictured right there for you to choose <unk> are good drinks i might add of course they take longer to make so the wait is longer that it should be even with the four bartenders i like the idea though the fish fry was pretty good there were two big pieces of fish and a large baked potato and a piece of bread on a plate that was too small they should have had the potato on a separate plate or just served it all on a lager one it was tricky to eat without knocking stuff off on the table oh and there was just one lonely butter patty for the bread and potato i would have asked for more but the waitstaff was only around when i didn t need her and not when i did lots of rubber <unk> for our late glass of wine as well they apparently only serve the waitstaff drinks at the far end of the bar so it was a long walk to the front of the place by the windows where we were they are trying hard to be the best here but it still needs a little tweaking i moved them up a star and liked the restaurant better than last time i would go back
how is it possible that a restaurant can keep <unk> my expectations every time we went with a huge group on saturday night and it was fab i love that the hosts at the door are always very happy to see you the food is delicious the menu has their the old gio s favourites like the huge meatball that my friend jane dreams about the grilled calamari that i dream out the specials are usually planned and thought out oh and delicious the servers are after my own heart not snobby very attentive knowledgeable and take demanding foodie friends in <unk> water always full or decanter on the table check side plates for appetizers check new cutlery after the appetizer check it might be worth noting that they have expanded the restaurant there used to be an <unk> next door that they now use for large parties i was loud and fun the only time that you will pay through the nose is if you don t watch how many bottle of wine are flying around
service was great and it s a solid local spot the pho was good but not <unk> a little more from such an authentic place but i would give it another shot could have been an off day and everyone else really enjoyed it
i love this place this little family owned sushi restaurant is the best i ve been to in arizona i go here every year for my birthday and my <unk> birthday s they are so sweet and friendly and make the most amazing sushi and soups and etc you will ever try so fresh and full of flavor you can never go wrong no matter what you order there is never a wait its great especially if your <unk> ll be rolling out once your done with this place
the food is ok not authentic i was a regular customer until the lady who sits at the counter was rude to me i pointed that out politely and she said that they receive too many customers and they cant speak politely to everyone so if you are looking for an example of how to turn away regular customers this is your place will never go back ever
came to have drinks with some friends over the holidays the bar is a lot nicer on the inside than you would expect and the bartenders were friendly and efficient they also had some pretty intense trivia going on along with plenty of tvs to watch the college bowl games pretty much everything you need in a bar environment unfortunately i didn t have a chance to sample the food that evening because i was on a strict liquid diet based on my one experience there i would definitely recommend giving this place a try
called in before i headed out to ask when was last call first the girl had no idea and asked the other staff and after discussing she said pm we made it before pm after a minute commute and the waitress said the chef had already left they were not apologetic at all and just said well there s no chef to make the food for you was definitely a disappointment since it use to be my late night sushi spot
i have to say that this location and the one inside the grocery store has some of the best starbucks staff members they know my name and my favorite customized drinks thanks for the smiles and great drinks
had the breakfast buffet yesterday it was really good and we went at am so we paid the breakfast price but also got the have lunch too
beautiful restaurant warm friendly service fair pricing and proper portions kibbeh <unk> fresh and clean delicate flavors simply delicious lamb shawarma tender well seasoned meat that melts in your mouth brussel sprout hearts with hazelnut fried delight <unk> with feta so good and creamy with one piece of warm home baked bread can t wait to return
wow i m so disappointed in this place sign out front clearly states that the drive thru is always open but there s never anyone there in the morning
at pm on a saturday night this place was at best maybe full not a great sign in itself we waited about minutes before a staff member came by and said someone should be with you soon five minutes later someone came by and seated us not at one of the several available spacious booths but at a small card table near the kitchen we had to ask for water which didn t come until much later when our soup came we had to ask for crackers one package to split between the two of us is all we received i decided to go all out and ask for my very own package of crackers and one package containing two saltines is exactly what i received generally in an italian restaurant garlic bread with olive oil and parmesan are brought with your appetizer nope supposedly you had a choice of either garlic or regular bread with each meal but when our meals came no bread we finally asked for and were given exactly one slice of bread each ok let s talk about the meal i had been going to this place for decades and i have always ordered the same thing half ravioli half spaghettini i started to inquire about this and this random woman cleaning a table behind us <unk> in quite loudly and aggressively we can t do that that just isn t possible um why would that be exactly it was possible the many other times i ve been there and as both items are still on the menu one <unk> over why this would suddenly not be possible most business establishments realize that making their customers happy is not only good business but a nice thing to do but ok message loudly and clearly received i picked the spaghettini and added meatballs we placed bets on how many meatballs close to extra would buy you at <unk> s i bet and i guess you could say i won if meatballs for nearly is winning not sure i do actually of our meals mine was the most edible and it tasted like a bowl of chef boyardee <unk> we all drank water which we did have to ask for and wasn t brought until our meal i guess that s a good thing and i wish we had drank it more slowly because that one glass was all any of us ever got my pregnant daughter in law was trying desperately to get extra drops out of the glasses she was so thirsty and my son gave up trying to get a refill they were t exactly busy but ok whatever by this point we pretty much knew what the answer was going to be to this next question but what the heck we were there specifically because my son s birthday was a few days ago and my daughter in law s is a few days away this was turning out to be quite the birthday celebration big shocker here no <unk> s could give a hot damn that you chose their establishment to celebrate your birthday in no free cake or even an extra package of saltines or a refill of that water you had to ask for so then the bill comes my daughter in law had asked for alfredo sauce to be substituted on her pasta dish by this point i m fully expecting a pretty healthy up charge for that although we weren t advised of it ahead of time i mean this entire thing from walking in the door to paying the bill and never coming back had been so <unk> mediocre at best i really didn t think they could surprise me anymore then i looked at the bill and yes there was an up charge of about to switch the sauce and another for a dish we didn t order written right underneath the dish she did order with the up charge listed below it then apparently the dish that would normally have come with the sauce she asked for we were charged for too but of course never asked for or received if the good had been great or the service out of this world in a good way maybe that would have <unk> some of the overall <unk> of this entire experience not a single one of us had a good meal and we truly aren t picky or high maintenance i ve been a waitress my sister is a waitress i still work in customer service and know what people can put you through we aren t <unk> we don t send food back if it s not perfect my daughter in law s salad dressing was full of watery substance my sauce was runny and my son s ravioli was half cold and we never sent anything back or asked for better we just tried to eat as best we could and get out of there <unk> that we d never go back nor would we recommend it to anyone we didn t hate this used to be a pretty good place to get a delicious meal at a decent price from friendly and attentive staff sadly none of that is true now by pm as i sat here trying to write this the parking lot was completely empty on a saturday night so i don t really think my review is really much of a surprise to anyone
this is not your ordinary tacos and burritos type place we had a delicious mole dish and chicken in a cream sauce the prices were very reasonable and the service was good
airport restaurant food never too impressive and just like this restaurant they are just trying to pump out the bar and food service took a little long i ordered the margarita grilled chicken which was a low calorie item didn t want to feel bloated on the plane food quality was below average the chopped tomato on top of the chicken was really cold so when i bit into it i thought the chicken was raw the chicken was really small way more rice than meat flavour there wasn t much to it but make sure you squeeze the lime into it to add it some acidic taste or else it is bland
we had the porkbelly steam bun and miso ramen noodles both dishes were very delicious and i wish we had one where i m from so i could keep coming back and trying different things the staff seemed friendly and the food came out quickly they have a good selection of beverages and the ice cream was very delicious as well great place for a quick delicious bite
the tacos were pretty authentic the staff was really friendly but he tacos were lacking a bit of flavour we tried majority of their flavours and all were lacking something the chips and salsa was really good though we tried it because it was closer to home then the other taco place we go to
came here for girls night on saturday and good thing we made a reservation the place was busy but busy usually means great food and the tacos sure didn t disappoint we had the aaa sirloin and fish tacos both highly recommended the flavours were just right and the spicy beef tacos definitely packed a punch i liked how the server brought one taco at a time so you have time to enjoy it before the other one got cold service was great as well
i was here for lunch on cinco de mayo this year we obviously had to get our mexican fix and i wasn t disappointed it was a great day and we got a nice table at their covered outdoor area the margaritas on special were good came in a plastic cup though the guac is made right at your table some find that really cool i find it gimmicky the guac is nothing fancy just your regular guac ingredients tomatoes onions cilantro jalape os and lime but yummy i also ordered the veggie stuffed peppers and a veggie empanada both of which were excellent the stuffed pepper appetizer is highly recommended we ended with their tequila cake which is a tequila infused tres leche it tasted like a regular tres leche with no sign of any tequila infusion but tasty nevertheless for vegetarians especially la palapa is one of the better mexican restaurants in the city and i ll definitely be back here again
i ve been here twice and both times it has been exceptional the owner was so accommodating of my son s food allergies he personally responded to a yelp message within an hour they food is delicious the drinks are divine and the atmosphere is fun i can t say enough good things
i went here for the lunch special a few weeks ago half of the party was running late but they sat us anyways while we waited for them which i loved the meal was pretty good but what i liked the best was the service i mentioned to my friend that i wished i had more pita of my appetizer which was the mezze plate which had a trio of dips then the next thing i knew a waiter who wasn t ours brought over a basket with more pita bread definitely go for the real awesome affordable lunch special and stay for the great service
chilly palmers is a great place to grab a beer and a bit to eat a friend and met there after work and man we really enjoy the happy hour we had five beers each a couple of orders of nachos and it came to one of the best happy hours in town last saturday went to chilly s for breakfast had the cornbeef hash and eggs and a short stack and was good the bartender was really good he kept our beers field and cold and he took with the dirty dishes from the nachos he was good the food servers were nice and very easy to approach and all four occasions we ve been lucky and have really good service if you re in green valley area i would recommend <unk> s for happy hour and also for breakfast there are other places to eat and drink in the area like miller s and pt s i would recommend chilly palmers over both of them
my first time trying a bahn mi from anywhere and it was delicious this place is amazing great customer service and really good variety of tea options i ordered the lemon grass chicken bahn mi and lychee tea with passion fruit jellies and both tasted great just be aware that there are fresh jalape os on the sandwiches so if you don t like spicy i advise to ask for it without the peppers
worth the long line in the mornings the sandwiches are large and you can pretty much get anything you might imagine with eggs
restaurant staff were extremely helpful and friendly but food was not that great chicken was dry and portuguese tart was cold and overly sweet fries were nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside but were extremely salty rice was bland but salad and dressing were ok food did not live up to the hype on this visit
used to be quite good sadly i could not eat more than a few bites of my spinach pesto which was made of mashed up spinach rather than basil and had no flavor even the cornbread was bad on the upside when i returned it uneaten they insisted on giving me some chili for free unfortunately that wasn t good either but i ate it because i was starving
so good i would recommend buying a pack of tortillas to take home with you while you are there they are always friendly and fast service
so delicious be prepared to wait a hour or longer in line i highly recommend the moist brisket and pecan pie the potato salad grits coleslaw were also very good there are a few tables inside and some long picnic tables outside we got a table inside without a wait the service was great the employees were very friendly and super nice they gave us free bottled water and samples while we waited in line i will be back
i decided to meet my friend for lunch in tempe as her work is right off of mill and rd street however she gives me a funky address that i type into my iphone instead of saying hey <unk> i work on rd street just off of mill and it leads me on a wild goose chase alas i finally get to the correct destination park and walk to meet her in the degree heat but <unk> says it feels like ha she asks me where i want to go and i say somewhere new which is easy for me because i haven t been on mill since she is naming off food joints as we are walking south on mill i pull out my yelp app and quickly type in lunch tempe and ncounter pops up i give this suggestion we stop walking turn around and look at how far the walk now is it really wasn t that far it was just the heat since i didn t think about this sooner just then she sees a coworker and asks for recommendations and his first choice in ncounter we look back at each other and decide to go for it this place is open monday sunday am pm and serves breakfast and brunch foods the inside was very refreshing with the cold ac open layout and tons of tables and chairs including one nice communal table they also have a small patio with misters my friend and i starred at the large menu and decided to split the <unk> and the peppered italian salad the <unk> comes with <unk> mushrooms roasted red peppers artichoke provolone cheese spinach and a balsamic mayo that is piles on a delicious grilled ciabatta bread and you have a choice of a side salad or chips to accompany the sandwich the peppered italian salad comes with grilled chicken atop of sauteed cashews red peppers and garlic over romaine lettuce with an italian parmesan dressing the salad was tasty but they went a little heavy on the dressing which is a total buzz kill for me next time i ll ask for the dressing on the side for drinks they offer anything from alcoholic beverages served at a smaller counter coffee tea smoothies and your traditional sodas and juices i opted for iced tea and appreciate that they offer a freshly brewed blackberry jasmine green tea and a passion fruit iced tea the service was great the employee taking our order offered up the peppered italian salad suggestion and the employee delivering our food noticed we were splitting our items and brought us out a separate plate use we also had our table top cleared pretty soon after we finished eating so we were able to enjoy our space and drinks while finishing out conversation before my friend had to go back to work we both agreed that the mild <unk> and heat stroke was worth it and that we both will be back
our first time here and we had the chicken wrap the santa fe cheeseburger and the chicken sandwich which were all equally delicious mike our server was very attentive and cordial their lunch menu on the weekends is really great as they have nine item for nine dollars with a lot of great selections to choose from and then another mini lunch menu that also was quite <unk> are no shortage of options and just really great atmosphere and food
i do not recommend this place i went with my wife and some friends on friday night to celebrate my wife s promotion and got racial <unk> by the guy checking id s i was wearing shorts and a plain black tee and when i got to the front of the line the bouncer told me your shorts are too <unk> then proceeded to tell me that they dont allow black tees in the place i looked around and half the people inside were wearing solid tees and also the gentleman behind me was also wearing a black tee but was able to go in with no issues i felt just because i m a mexican guy with a bald head and tattoos i was <unk> as a gang <unk> and was not allowed to get in to a so called mexican restaurant never judge a book by its cover people i m a dad of kids and husband to a beautiful wife i own my own home and make decent money but because of the way i look i wasn t allowed to get in i will never be going to this place again and ill make sure to spread the word on how i was treated
one of the better kegs not all are the same this place has a consistency in service and food quality
great small plates and awesome atmosphere latin cuisine won t disappoint and the bar drinks were awesome enjoyed this vegas venetian find
really good for your money the ceviche tostadas are big and will get you full and the bacon wrapped jalapenos are delicious so are the <unk> s
my friend and i ate her today and the patio was amazing besides that our server ian was excellent and worked his butt off would for sure go back and love to have him again and of course the meal and cheesecake was the best part of the visit would recommend
local breeze is delish i will return
i had hopes for a really good meal here and ordered the pork ribs i love pork ribs these were probably the worst ribs i have ever had they were not only overdone but i had difficulty telling the difference between the meat and the bone a steak knife could not cut through the charred and overdone meat when i told the server about this he came back from the chef with a message that sometimes the meat was smoked too long and overdone no apology that s just the way it was any chef with any sort of pride in his work would never send out burned meat and make a lame excuse for it i hope that guy fieri would be embarrassed that this meal had come from his kitchen if you go there stay away from the ribs the service was very good but i won t return
casa <unk> s food is by far the best mexican food here and i ve lived in az for the past years however the service at this particular location is not so great and the restaurant doesn t seem too clean which is why i gave it a now if you visit the main location on mill southern service is consistently fantastic great chile relleno so my husband says best he s ever had and he s mexican and i love their tamales
uno de los mejores <unk> <unk> buffet <unk> am to am autentica comida mexicana y <unk> americanos omelets pancakes <unk> etc personal muy <unk>
i had been meaning to try place for a while it s a stone throw away from my old high school shadow mountain so i was happy to see a new restaurant breathe life into this strip mall i ve now gone twice in the last month and each time i ve been pleasantly delighted with the weather finally cooling down their patio is nice and serene with trees and <unk> surrounding it for a brief moment you forget you are in parking lot it s also nice that their patio is pet friendly as well so on the first visit i got their omg sandwich oh my was it good it s a combination of prosciutto mascarpone fig and honey need i say more on my second visit i got their tuna sandwich the tuna salad was good the only thing i wish is that they could offer another type of bread besides ciabatta since it seemed like the bread to tuna salad ratio was a little off other than that i m a firm believer in local businesses and i hope this one continues to thrive
simple but great the service is always friendly and quick the food is never greasy
this chilis is very busy during lunch they always try really hard with in store carry out orders sometimes they make mistakes but it s okay
it s a pretty good sign when you walk into a diner and see that the cops eat there decent diner food heavy on the starches at a very reasonable price point service could have been friendlier but the food was tasty and filling so i expect i ll be back the next time i need a hangover breakfast in the area
ounce steak <unk> was cooked to a perfect medium with buttery garlic cloves and mushrooms chopped salad was delicious would have been stars but there was a noisy group two tables away from me
first of all our waitress was adorable she was so attentive and sweet and i just really enjoyed our experience and she was a big part of it second of all the food was great we ordered the baba ganoush and two of the dinner plates along with some baklava for dessert all the items were made with fresh ingredients and generously portioned i also loved the hot sauce that came alongside the appetizer we will certainly be dining here again
my wife and i go here almost every weekend the food is great and the service is always great too good beer selection and the mimosa s and bloody mary s are awesome as well
ok so here we are at the old standard hooley house westlake s sports bar behind yard house the browns radio shows usually do <unk> here today ken <unk> w the coaches show on <unk> mitchell is the guest and he was a good dude see pic i get the hooley hunks tots the bro did the same and they re good cute staff always it helps loud place great to watch any games they have a million tv it s not great it s not bad it is what is is day drunks crowd are the regulars come to hit on the barmaid last chance saloon crowd but i ve been there myself so how can i cast the first stone tonight is football thur so grown ass men in jerseys for my that only works with hockey but hey i come here for events lately i do my day drinking elsewhere but i m trying to cut down stars come on in and watch the game chicken hunks are not bad other stuff sliders i guess pizza is meh don t go there it s down the way from the hacienda so there s that
i am only rating off of our experience at the bar we did not eat went in late on a saturday night and sat at the bar the place wasn t very full the first thing we noticed was how loud it was they play the music loudly and even though it wasn t full it felt very loud we wonder what it sounds like when it is busy not the best ambiance because of this doesn t seem to match the look we kept saying they needed to add some panels to help absorb the sound i do like the look of the restaurant however we sat at the bar and didn t have the best experience we didn t even get greeted when we sat at the bar and the bartender was only a step or two from us it was not busy and there were three bartenders we simply had a menu slid towards us once the bartender did take our order he did not ask us if we had any questions or help explain the drinks he walked over and simply looked at us it honestly felt like we were bothering him i ordered a manhattan and my husband ordered the <unk> i know it s gimmicky but i love the taste of smoky drinks the presentation of the <unk> is beautiful the manhattan was solid and small the <unk> was good but was not near as great as i wanted it to be i have had better smoky drinks in town my last concern with this place is the prices not all of us are on a banker s <unk> the manhattan was not even a specialty version the <unk> was ouch ouch ouch if things are going to cost this much they have to be great and these were just not worth it and neither was the experience i recently had a bartender make me a custom smoked version of an old fashioned from scratch for so this feels absurd we live within walking distance of this place so i was very disappointed i will likely not return i understand they are a restaurant and not a bar but i m hesitant to return and try the food because of the above experience a kind engaged bartender would ve likely changed our entire experience
i have been eating sushi a long time this place was so wonderful great sushi i strongly recommend eating here enjoy
after spending all the money and energy in concord mills we started looking out for a thai place apparently for my lady thai food is something that will provide her with all the energy and wisdom lol nah we both love thai food so yelp says go to mai thai ii the restaurant was looking very neat and spacious enough the waitress were polite and welcoming not much crowd that night so we were seated and attended pretty quickly we did not try any new stuff but rather ordered our regular chicken pad thai for myself and chicken fried rice for me lady but we said make it spicy of course the waitress asked how spicy like a or i wish i knew the hot spice levels of each and every restaurant and how it <unk> to the number or ugh i do not understand that logic of saying a number to determine the spice level especially when its a first time to the restaurant and especially when you feel like eating spicy anyways we said coz we wanted a nice spicy meal that night my pad thai was looking delicious it was a treat to the eyes loved the presentation and all but it was super hot i infact loved the first few bites because there is this underlying sweetness of the pad thai sauce but after a point my mouth and my eyes were both watering lol pad thai was tasting really good but i would have enjoyed more if i had made a wise choice of spice level chicken fried rice with extra vegetables was just as good nothing extra ordinary or special again too spicy bottom line please make sure to choose wisely with spice levels service was great ambience was neat
quite a large menu with everything from montreal smoked meat eggs benny to chicken waffles to liver onions small street front but plenty of tables inside very friendly staff decent food and generous portions like the name everything seems to come with eggs even the benny
if you re italian and know good italian food don t go here we saw the good reviews and figured we d check it out let s just say we were disappointed we started off with the spinach artichoke dip and that was eh lacked flavor my boyfriend got the veal <unk> and could barely eat it i had a pasta dish and it was ok i really wouldn t recommend this place unless you re looking for cheap italian food
so i only had a milkshake but burgers just aren t my thing it was a damn good milkshake ok they need to provide bigger straws considering how thick it was i love all the flavor options i got salted caramel and peanut butter my dad got chocolate and <unk> milk it had no malt flavor actually so that sucked
this restaurant on the outside is not very noticeable so its pretty easy to overlook but i think it should get more exposure i always used to bike past it and didn t think much but after coming here i can say that the chicken adobo and rice i got was one of the best meals i ve ever had this was my first time having filipino food and it did not disapoint the only thing i didnt like was the halo halo and everything took a while to get made so maybe order ahead if youre getting takeout otherwise everything was amazing and i can t wait to come and eat here more
not only was the food delicious but the service was superior our waiter tracy aka hatch was extremely knowledgeable of not only the food but the beer menu as well he is a shining star and i would definitely come back for his hospitality alone if you want to put a little south in your <unk> is the place to go
we got in line minutes early before it opened we re a bunch of girls and we got here early instead of getting our asses early to get into a club we like to eat well worth it though omfg just being able to go back for as much sashimi and oysters that i want plus our server was so adorable and helpful it just makes so much sense to spend dollars here so much sense
excellent pizzas with simple good quality ingredients i especially like the funghi and palate pizzas paired with a salad as others have mentioned the prices are really reasonable especially given the food quality two small pizzas and a salad to share with no drinks works out to or so the ambience is quite casual and no fuss nice for a weeknight meal and get together with friends the only thing i think they could improve is letting customers know when they are out of certain ingredients for example yesterday night we ordered a grilled <unk> salad there were a couple small pieces of <unk> but it was largely a mixed green salad on another visit we ordered the <unk> salad which the menu lists as having basil leaves but couldn t find or taste any when we received it it s understandable that some ingredients may not be available due to the seasonal nature of the items and we would probably have chosen other items on the menu instead
the desserts here are spectacular everything looks good and taste good very authentic
i have not had a chance to eat a burger at in out since i lived in california the burger is good but as far as flavor goes i would take guys or shake shack the fries are excellent but you need to hurry and eat them before they cool down shake are also excellent
so a super nice albeit kinda <unk> sorry bartender at a downtown pgh bar recommended we try the georgetown inn for dinner i never ever hesitate to check my trusty yelp app while out and about after reading many negative reviews from reliable yelpers thank you we decided against dinner here and opted to just grab a drink we re glad we decided against it for dinner it s not that we had a horrible experience or anything we sat at the bar for a couple of whiskey sours i guess i just got a bad vibe like people were cranky here or something the place had semi creepy ambiance too otherwise drinks were good extremely overpriced but good
not a good location poor customer service every time i order they never get it right told me to call corporate if i have a complaint never ordering from here again
recently tried this place i was afraid to try thinking it would be outrageously expensive guess what you get what you pay for nice <unk> <unk> love to go again

americanized asian food they have a good vegetarian vegan menu selection the vegetarian pot stickers were good with a delicious sauce they even have vegetarian pho that i will try next time
the duck wings are great with the spicy flavor <unk> in the sweetness the all american burger is cooked to my order but it is just ok the lobster shrimp <unk> is a little grease but does have a lot of lobster meat and shrimps the butcher steak is totally <unk> cooked and not hot at all when it is served our waiter is very friendly and ask the kitchen for replacement our foods come in very slowly and my kids asked me a thousand times when our food will be here the overall service is ok and foods are good
this establishment is walking distance from my friends house and we popped in here to celebrate her birthday it was a nice sunny evening and we were sat on the patio and served immediately it wasn t a busy evening which was nice i was craving a chicken pot pie which is exactly what i had for dinner and it was delicious we had the lobster appetizer as well although i wasn t a fan of it as it wasn t real lobster i thought it was super sweet that they brought out a little treat for my girl s birthday a great local establishment
loved everything about this place for the quality of food they put out and it s fresh well priced great service and beautiful place to eat all healthy
i really craved for sushi when we got to vegas and i thought to give sushisamba a chance i been at the miami location and it was great the lv location is almost great as the one in miami the sushi was good not great just average sushi the thing is they charge you a lot for a small sushi roll we came in slow time pm so the kitchen was red in any rush but still the service was very slow and took them long time to service us overall the experience was nice but i really remembered sushisamba as a blow mind sushi
honestly expected the best walking in got the worst coming out talk about reputation worst ribs ever <unk> old and drenched in nasty bbq sauces i should have just driven a mile down the street for the best bbq in vegas
food quality price ish for baby sized entrees which imo is the perfect size for the regular person i really loved the dragon i was pleasantly surprised the the quality of the dishes here for a vegetarian restaurant there is a lot of stir fry a staple for chinese cuisine so most entrees are served with chopsticks the quinoa onion rings are to die for portions are just right my only issue was that my entree was drenched in sauce it was a good sauce but it was like a soup near the end the solution ask the waitress to tell them easy on the sauce second was that i asked for some extra cilantro and was told i d be charged an additional cents for it so i passed the second time i went the dish didn t even come with cilantro so when i asked they gave me a huge bowl double the amount the first time facility noisy and crowded i m <unk> nearly elbow to elbow with the party next to us and can definitely hear what they re talking about washrooms are okay typical of downtown wait time to be seated was minimal but the place was pretty packed service left much to be desired the waitress es did their job at the bare minimum but i was not at all impressed by any of it the bill also took forever to get there and then forever to get the change also not impressed with the sass i got after asking about my food which took over minutes to arrive overall a great place to eat when you want to change up the pace however it is crowded and don t expect phenomenal service you ll be going for the food
service was horrible we sat at the bar thinking it would be quicker however the bartender seem to be taking care of the entire restaurant food was good but nothing great don t think we will be back
i really wanted to like this place it s extremely close to my new house and i love a good mexican place that has a drive through for those nights when you want good food but don t feel like going in unfortunately it just didn t live up to my hopes the chicken tacos were decent but the enchilada sauce rice and beans had no flavor very bland and to top it off the cheese enchilada was so cold the shredded cheese inside the enchilada wasn t even melted so disappointing i am a se or taco regular but the closest location doesn t have a drive through not the most ideal situation when i m <unk> around my kids but i ll choose it over eating here again
i ve been coming to peppermill for years it is by far the best breakfast drunk or sober in las vegas consistently good service and huge food portions
great food great service really like this place and their menu is unique and delicious have been back several times great place for a date or to meet friends or to celebrate a special occassion
my mom wanted to go here for lunch last friday i was actually kinda excited because it s been a few years since i last came here parking was a bitch that was a task in itself any way we made our way back to the hostess stand was told there would be a minute wait for lunch really we decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait lindsey was our server she was so sweet checked on us often too for starters we ordered the bistro calamari boom dip i forgot how big the portions are what were we thinking ordering apps the boom dip was yummy but the calamari was just ok way too much breading coating for our entree we decided to split the aunt margherita pizza thin crust added artichokes my mom only had a bite since she ate a lot of the apps i had a slice it was ok pretty bland in flavor barely any cheese the crust had a similar texture to cardboard i took the leftovers home my hubby agreed he wasn t <unk> the pizza either total not including tip was about while the food was just ok the service was great i d like to come back sooner than a few years because i know i ve had good food here in the past i think next time i need to order some pasta definitely the pizza cookie
phenomenal restaurant i have returned to the border grill numerous times and my experiences could not get any better the pescado <unk> is to die for every meal i have eaten there has been perfect the servers are attentive and knowledgeable and a manager has come by my table every time to ensure i am satisfied this is an a operation and my favorite place to eat in las vegas
i came here for the first time last night and i was lucky enough to meet two friends in the parking lot they led me through the process and made it easy for a taco y taco newbie to order what i wanted the staff was super friendly and i soon had two tacos one al pastor and one of their vampiro i also got an elote the first time i ve had this at a mexican restaurant i am a fan of this street food for sure the tacos were good i got everything on the al pastor and the pineapple tends to overwhelm the rest of the taco i also dumped a fair amount of their hottest salsa on so tasting for details wasn t too much of an option i got the vampiro with carnitas the server grabbed a large piece of pork that was <unk> in some nice juices and sliced away to put in the vampiro this was very tasty and i m glad i got it as for the elote i really am a fan the cotija and then dusting with mexican chili powder make for a great taste combination last night was mariachi monday and there was a mariachi band playing in the <unk> and just inside the restaurant for about the first hour i was there it did make conversation a bit difficult but it added to the atmosphere the restaurant has a partial second floor which gives you more options for sitting however when you forget something like getting a drink and some plastic utensils it s down the steps and back up again better to get your hunger on a bit more as i said before the staff was really great they ll ham it up and pose for any photo op you want and they are helpful in answering any questions the ladies at thew register were just the same this really was a good stop for tacos
they didn t have what i went in for the tea was very good and fair price the grill was closed but the hours on the wall said it should of been opened i loved the shaded area up front but we couldn t use it because the grill area was closed the butcher was alone working on a busy saturday and i know this because she said she was by herself today with no help it was green hatch chili week and they had non i won t go back to this particular location i wish they made one in queen creek or gilbert
unbelievable service adam treats all of his customers like family serves bakery delicacies that cant be found anywhere else in az coming here every time i want to eat amazing vibe and atmosphere i never yelp but this was def worth it will be back for croissants tomorrow
so it appears pretty new so they were still working out some organization kinks however the manager working there tonight was cool calm and collected even when some orders were mixed hes a diamond and the reason i will return despite the extended wait time
this place is going down hill fast i come here pretty regularly for breakfast the service is getting more rude and each dish i get is increasingly lower in quality flavor and temperature service today was really slow and less than professional when asked for my order i ordered slowly while she was <unk> with the register after i was finished she said ok what was it you wanted again if you aren t ready don t ask me what i want really rude and frustrating to think you re being heard only to have to repeat yourself last time i was here i got their breakfast parfait the fruit was less than fresh as they tout on their menu the bread that came on he side was once warm and crumbled when i attempted to pick it up this time i got the breakfast sandwich the potatoes were not cooked at all normally they are brown this time they were still white and incredibly greasy the sausage on the sandwich was absolutely flavorless the eggs were cooked too long and were served brown and crispy there was hardly any cheese to speak of oh and don t even get me started on them if they have a line they have two registers but do not use them they will let the line get to the door with and still only use one i ve walked in and out a few times because they are incredibly slow if you want a sweet treat and there is no line this is the place to stop in if not don t bother
love coming here with my family they discovered this chinese spot this is prob one of the best chinese places in vegas it s always busy though the service should be a lot better but i guess that s typical at any chinese asian restaurant you go to you can never go wrong with your order everything is made to please
i come here every couple of months for the past few years and i must say they are doing pretty well ie maintained the food quality and portion while also adding new dishes options to their menu they are typically pretty busy despite having a fair number of tables would recommend coming there slightly before the peak lunch dinner hours just to avoid the potentially long lineup
i love sonic but will never get another blast i ordered a medium reese s blast with chocolate ice cream which was really just vanilla ice cream with a little chocolate syrup and a few bits of reese s in about every third bite from now on i will be going to culvers when i want a treat
we went to the beach club a lot when it first opened they ve always had good food and drink but at a price an example was friday night during happy hour we had a bowl of soup wedge salad the meatball beers and a glass of iced tea without happy hour prices the bill with tip would have been years ago there was a problem getting a seat at the bar on a friday night that s not the case now
have eaten here several times since the restaurant opened the food is outstanding we have tried a number of the dishes on the menu which is extensive our favorites include the wagyu sliders the spicy tuna on the wasabi crackers the crab stack garlic chicken and if you have a sweet tooth the apple banana fritters all <unk> can t say enough about the wait staff efficient and most attentive to us we are already regulars
went here for breakfast on recommendation from a friend had the bacon vodka caesar and the <unk> classic eggs benny the caesar was tasty and presentation was excellent with a slice of bacon pickled asparagus and olive <unk> it tastes like they used some sort of low quality bacon flavouring in the drink though perhaps bacon flavoured vodka which makes this not so great of a deal at imo the benedict was cooked perfectly not too runny and not too hard the home fries were a miss no flavour to them at all they could really use some seasoning or accompaniment all in all everything was good not great at the prices they re charging for it though i don t think i d go back
overpriced overpriced overpriced not sure who is rating this higher than stars unless they just have too much money of us had dinner and were disappointed for the exorbitant cost scallops were good but scallops with no other offering for dollars tater tots were mediocre and would have been better off getting hash browns at at chick a <unk> salmon tartar was inedible and pumpkin custard taste like a sponge and we had them take it off menu burgers were ok but go somewhere else for cost
new york deli sandwiches right here in vegas great food great vibes nothing like it in town
ok i get it that everyone is excited you finally opened we party of came in today for brunch after asking two waiters time for water and half way thru my meal i finally got water i also asked our waiter for the habanero sauce which i had to remind him again half way thru my meal after paying our check of decided to have a shot of <unk> tequila i went to the bar where i stood for over minutes while the bartender and servers watched the game ignoring me i left and the returned still no service i finally said in a loud voice to the bartender quit watching the game and get me our drinks this is a terrible way to keep customers not sure we will return for shots that i pretty much had to beg to get is rediculous happy holidays
destination after a walk along the canal from scottsdale googled breakfast near me and that s how i ended up here delicious burrito large portions and service was fast and professional casual and family friendly i would definitely recommend
the flavour of the burger was good but left me un satisfied and the side of fries was fresh but small and once again un satisfying the food was tasty but expensive compared to many of the other us chains that have ventured north the restaurant itself was <unk> with garbage on the carpet with a bunch of dirty tables
the grand canal shoppes food court is somewhat always in a state of <unk> the no <unk> and i visit the shoppes at least ever year for the last four years partly because we end up staying at the palazzo for his conference and while we can count on staples such as johnny rockets subway and wasabi jane there s always one or two new business that open up that replaced the businesses that closed curry pot was a new addition for this year their slogan is american made authentically indian while i haven t eaten at enough indian restaurants to make informed decisions about its authenticity what the no <unk> and i can tell you that this was one of the better indian places we tried no <unk> s also picky about his indian food as he can get a good plate back in japan he was initially hesitant about my choice because his stomach doesn t go well with bad indian food but i had a good gut feel about this place considering the affluent environment of the venetian palazzo complex it has to cater to a wide range of <unk> the menu options are more limited than traditional indian curry houses but what s unique about this particular indian joint is their limited south indian options normally traditional curry houses are staffed by people from the northern part of india so you wouldn t see masala dosa served here curry pots served with cumin saffron basmati rice naan bread salad chicken tikka masala chicken creamy tomato sauce red chili paste herbs spices classic chicken curry chicken onion tomato sauce ginger garlic paste herbs spices no <unk> got the tikka masala while i got their classic curry chicken as mentioned we enjoyed our plates because not only was it delicious but it was also one of the healthier options in the food court we noted that the curries were at least moderately spicy which we didn t mind as we re used to moderately spicy we didn t specify spice levels and we don t know whether this could be adjusted for people who can t tolerate spicy food portions were quite big for a curry dish as there was a generous amount of chicken and a good amount of sauce for the naan we could have ended up sharing a curry pot and it would ve been adequate for lunch we did note a few concerns with our dishes the naan that was served was actually pita cooked in the style of naan though it was still a good bread and went well with the curry sauce the business does advertise themselves as authentically indian i would think indians would have an issue with this the salad contains too much onions needs more greens i didn t mind this as much as i love onions with my curry and it was sprinkled with cumin the no <unk> ate one of the peppers and it was enough for him to be bothered by it for at least minutes as he s somewhat lactose intolerant mango lassi was out of the question and had to get rid of the lingering spice with beer upon inspection i noticed there was quite a bit of green pepper seeds in the salad again i like my spice so this wasn t much of an issue but i don t know how a person with a lower tolerance of spice would handle it even with mild concerns the no <unk> and i would come back here for a quick lunch should we be in the area hopefully this place does well enough so we could come back here again next year i was bummed that i couldn t go back to anchor bar last year s food court lunch so i hope tourists will be more open minded to try food court indian
great sandwiches and awesome people try the long trail the housemade beef is the best i ve ever had
was attending a concert at the park theater with a friend we ate at tom s urban in new york new york as it is within walking distance the atmosphere was very pleasant we ate inside as it was mid summer it was a wednesday at pm and not too crowded or loud the menu was huge i ordered the philly prime rib sandwich which was delicious my friend ordered the lobster tacos and they were delicious i saw so many things on that huge menu i d love to try very good and pleasant service too the drinks were high priced but not as pricey as the drinks at the park theater i m looking forward to eating at tom s urban again meals range from to
when you want to know where to go for poor customer service this place is the perfect definition of it never again will i step foot after our first and last visit to this horrid establishment customer service in my eyes plays a huge role if you are treated poorly what is the purpose to come back with their food not being anything amazing as well we had come to this establishment for sushi night and sake bombs for the boys their small sake bottle they give you with a huge bottle of beer to match but doesnt match really because theres maybe shots worth of sake and the beer with sake should be about shots rather than after waiting for our food for a good amount of time passed our huge amount of food ordered came out and was decent but not for the price we paid not a deal what so ever so as we are still having a good time eating and talking to one another about random things and what not my boyfriend got up to look at something on the tv since it was close by but not close enough for him to see what the score was on a game so as he got up to look the restaraunt was closing up and we were the last couples in the place putting money in their pockets for the day the owner or manager in a little button up tommy bahama type looking short asian man had gone up to my boyfriend and said can i help you with something very rudely said and my boyfriend responded no i was just checking the score the manager basically cut him off and said well then lets go so my boyfriend came back to the table and had said i think they want us to go so we closed our check and had hurried as fast as we could i understand when establishments close it is time to go but if its a mom and pop shop or restaraunt i believe in more or better customer service in order to get a tip i do not believe i have to tip over if i was treated poorly my boyfriend is too nice when it comes to tips in my opinion i believe people need to work for their money and just not expect so much from people if they don t try hard enough you treat me poorly i don t return or i <unk> an apology of some sort if not you can expect no more money from my bank account their food and service what we paid for was ridiculous i will never ever return i hope they shut down i think if a wait staff is really nice we would have been treated better then this on our first time here for what we paid i could have gotten triple the food in other place i know of and as far as portions go of the people that went including myself were still hungry leaving
this place was amazing the food was high quality fresh and so tasty the gentleman that helped me and my mom was so sweet i m looking forward to eating here again
decent ayce restaurant limited vegetarian sushi options though what i ordered was tasty veggie blast roll with sweet potato and avocado and honey wasabi sauce veggie handrolls were decent not <unk> with rice vegetable teriyaki was flavourful though not authentic stir fried broccoli with garlic and a few chunks of carrot zucchini and mushroom dessert options were typical ice cream flavours green tea mango red bean as well as mango pudding and mango yogurt i opted for the latter which was a small shot glass of plain yogurt topped with mango puree yummmm service was prompt and efficient with no missed dishes i do wonder how long they will stay in business noticed they removed their hibachi option and the teppanyaki tables i miss their previous incarnation taste of japan it always seemed to be busy so not sure what happened
can t go wrong with cleveland vegan everything i ve had has been delicious healthy so great to have a place like this on the westside i highly recommend it even if you re a meat eater
their food is good but we were there for three hours the other day the waitress admitted that they were always under staffed their fries are popular but i opted for the bottomless broccoli which arrived well after everyone else had their fries and apparently you need to specifically request more although they might have been too generous with their endless lemonade they actually gave me a second before i drank the first a couple of times she said they bring out more until you ask them to stop
i ve been to this place a couple times now i know it s been good in the past but today i decided to try the carbonara s colossal calzone i really wanted a stromboli instead but this place like many other italian joints doesn t offer one even though they offer a very similar calzone the calzone was good for what it s worth it s very big has a lot of toppings inside but not a ton of ricotta overall i d say a
i m so <unk> favorite chinese restaurant in the valley has closed we drove all the way from goodyear to eat dinner and when we arrived we found tott s closed with only a sign that said closed relocating we almost started crying as we dream about tott s and look forward to making the trek across town for their terrific food i sure hope they open back up maybe in goodyear
very good food so flavorful and tender eggplant was amazing my husband ordered the beef special and was so delicious so many delicious spices i was afraid to try this place just because it s different than my normal american cuisine i m glad i did
pacos tacos is awesome beautiful home made tex mex food beautiful blue agave tequila and a friendly upbeat atmosphere and staff here the guacamole is amazing whether it s done table side or already on your tacos portions are large and good for sharing to mix and match and try a few things <unk> haw pacos well done
a small asian restaurant excellent food very spicy if you enjoy that you simply have to choose the number on a scale of to however start with five or less if you are not used to hot food we had pad thai and a curry dish both were excellent try it out you ll enjoy it
one of my favorites for cheap fast and tasty mexican it s definitely low key and casual but for a scrumptious chimichanga with terrific queso and a heavy on the tequila margarita this place has it all
i m not sure if i came in at a bad time i came in for lunch with my friend and it was certainly busy when we were seated our waitress was very friendly at first she was very attentive which she should be considering how expensive this restaurant is i ordered the fettuccine alfredo and when it came out it looked delicious it tasted absolutely horrible it was loaded down with garlic and it ended up making me throw up sick i called the manager over and he didn t offer to take it off the check or anything i told him to just bring me a burger to go the waitress came back out about minutes later with the burger and it wasn t in a to go box i had to ask her to bring me a box for it and she had an attitude i said thank you and was continuously polite throughout my visit and she never said you re welcome or anything very polite back whenever i said thank you she just turned away she wasn t horribly rude but i definitely expect more for such an expensive restaurant after we left about minutes later i had to go to the bathroom and throw up i won be coming back this restaurant is not at all what it is talked up to be
had an overall great experience here i was even surprised that they were able to cater to my gluten allergy with a spelt pasta option would defintely consider going back here
my husband and i have been going to this location for years it has been our fall winter go to when we want a good steak dinner we had a horrible experience tonight food quality and portions were disappointing the steaks were thin <unk> overcooked i used to love the fresh veggies carrots cauliflower broccoli instead we got a few limp and oily pieces of pepper and one piece of cauliflower the service was poor our server rushed us through our order brought our food and she was no where to be seen until we finished our meal we didn t even get water the manager offered us a free <unk> card for our next visit and he took off the bill it has really changed the place was dead we won t be going back
this place is a complete disaster we stood in various lines for an hour in the cold f c at p through midnight because they couldn t properly communicate with their patrons on which line was which this happened to a few groups of people not just us then the bouncer who really seemed like he wanted to show off his power the only place he has power started screaming at people to pay attention when he talked that was the st time we heard him communicating with anyone irony he didn t really say anything except to tell people to pay attention when he <unk> out orders what a <unk> then they proceeded to let in a bunch of sleazy gross <unk> looking patrons which was pretty much the last straw for us and the group in front of us and the group behind us they pretty much lost about people in the span of when we left and went to wood globe and crescent street <unk> the line we were standing in barely moved and it was p what idiot club makes ppl stand in line when they first open people who had been in the club came out to let us know it was pretty much empty in there except for ppl who were there for dinner and were rolling out which is really stupid and ridiculous to make ppl stand in line in freezing temp when we could have been inside spending money on tons of alcohol typical stupid disorganized wannabe club if it wasn t for my friends who were visiting from sf i d not have waited at all waiting in line for an hour at a <unk> completely passe and ish no like i <unk> disaster don t bother there re plenty of other places to check out
<unk> is a southern style tapas restaurant with inventive dishes and a very nice and intimate ambiance would recommend ordering dishes for people highlights mussels on toast this was soooo good and my fav dish of the evening the baguette toast was crispy and loaded with mussels the chow chow relish on top kind of tasted like caramelized onions and complemented the mussels really well there was so much flavour with each bite <unk> river farms wagyu this dish was really creative similar to a beef carpaccio but also served with mini <unk> pancakes that you put the wagyu on although the dish was really tasty there was so much garnish on the wagyu that it really overpowered the beef and i could barely taste the meat still worth a try lowlights fried chicken skins this dish was ok but i would only recommend ordering for a group of as i got sick of it after a few bites the taste and texture was similar to deep fried calamari but without the octopus short ribs i was expecting traditional bone in short ribs and was disappointed by this dish the meat was served on a skewer and tasted bland definitely not worth fried chicken this was a highlight that turned into a <unk> the chicken was seasoned perfectly very crispy on the outside and the meat was really juicy and moist unfortunately it was not cooked all the way through and the middle was raw we told the server and he immediately took it back and advised that they would make it again for us although this was a major no no the staff handled the situation really well and even offered to comp our entire meal yes you read that correctly this shows me that they really stand behind their quality and service the chicken the nd time around was executed perfectly overall this restaurant is good to try once or as a late night snack with friends drinks are really yummy the pricing is a bit steep for what you get and there are many other good restaurants that i would rather go to in that price <unk>
the food if you re going here you might as well splurge like you already are order the <unk> yaki it s at least worth of wagyu beef that you ll season and toss on your own hot stone leaving it to cook to your liking you may also offend your neighbors they ll envy your plate but they may also not like how the smoke is incidentally <unk> in their direction by the vents the wild mushroom <unk> yaki is on the salty side the tiger shrimp tempura is more than enough for people despite being labeled as a small plate loved it i didn t like the lobster taquitos because of the lemongrass and ginger the watermelon mojo beverage had too much mint for my liking i ll be back to try out other dishes the service i m also not typically a fan of asian cuisine but i definitely enjoyed most of everything else that was ordered i appreciate the waiter serving my table for making recommendations and yes up selling they definitely came by to check on us very often lucky side note i think i ve decided on going to sushisamba during their slow times right after the holidays and before new years eve it sounds like this place is less hectic during this time frame even so i managed to have a piece of plastic <unk> my direction during dinner i thought i had been drinking too much or a part of the restaurant s decor had started to <unk> but nope it was a patron s credit card that somehow flew out of one s hand and landed behind my seat cushion and the wall lighting <unk> they nearly had the whole place turned upside down trying to find the thing my date and i should have taken this luck to go gambling afterwards
love this place super friendly service and awesome food desserts their custard is worth the trip by itself but try the culvers deluxe burger for sure
let me start by <unk> did not expect this in <unk> a <unk> is a very sexy steakhouse the bartenders are on their <unk> started with shrimp cocktail you want to talk about big <unk> guys were huge to an order almost ruined my <unk> i had to press <unk> split a salad between of us clean refreshing great flavors and spot <unk> were of us so we opted to split <unk> in filet ny strip and a <unk> quality on this <unk> many places with this quality of <unk> sides were mac and cheese mashed potato and steamed <unk> cutting edge but all sides were cooked to perfection and <unk> ordered a bottle of wine and we had the sommelier diego come over and help us pick our <unk> dude knows his stuff we just wanted to get a nice buzz and he <unk> our surprise the chef was cruising the dining room checking on guests when he approached our table that really impressed <unk> is very proud of what he is serving as he should be this place is <unk> notch service and <unk> it up gang we will be <unk> for the hot blonde my girl she loved her server brandon
it s so nice here relaxing is good not bad it s been really renovated and it s nice <unk> vacation and enjoying the place
i came here a couple of times because its convenient due to the location of the area the service and quality of food is extremely disappointing as chicken was their only option since they burned their beef friends and i went to the location at yonge and sheppard area for some am shwarma and the next morning all of us were <unk> on the toilets for hours to come due to food poisoning to be honest i m actually writing this review on the toilet because i have been stuck inside my washroom for hours the pain in my stomach feels like <unk> <unk> my stomach from the inside and the outside and it is extremely upsetting because no restaurant should be serving food thats been contaminated or has gone bad i hope this establish steps up its game
went to this restaurant for the first time after it changed owner this is an upscale restaurant and it reflects on the prices of the dim sum i took a photo of the dim sum menu it looks very nice and show pictures of some of the dim sum one can <unk> the menu and can clearly see the description of the items the entrance is vastly improved from the old one the decor is good and service is good too the quality of the dim sum is a mix bag based on what we ordered see photos overall we have a good experience and will definitely go back again
the server was super nice there s salsa bar which had some amazing guacamole i totally reccomend it the tacos are simple which is good in its own way the breakfast burito ok too overall it s an enjoyable experience only one thing wrong when going to take my order i saw a cockroach on the ground even upon sitting down i saw baby cockroaches on my table maybe it ll be cleaner next time
i wouldn t bother coming here there are so many good food places in town the server was very attentive and provided great service but the food was just mediocre at best i was lucky enough to have coupons but i would have been very upset if i paid full price for this food i had the sirloin steak and it was lukewarm by the time i got it the sides were unimpressive
warm taco chips and excellent dips were served ann s entr e was a chile relleno a roasted poblano pepper manchego cheese <unk> cotija cheese tomatillo salsa spanish rice and refried black beans i settled on yucatan pork achiote pork roasted in a banana leaf grilled pickled onion guacamole fried plantains refried black beans spanish rice and handmade corn tortillas we have enjoyed both of these entrees in the past and were not disappointed this evening i had a few extra dollars left to use on our gift certificate so we ordered half slices of flan and a tres leches cake with passion fruit and prickly pear sauce
im from new orleans so i thought my mom would love this for mothers <unk> the service was excruciatingly <unk> seated literally mins before water arrived <unk> before of the drinks ordered came to the table food took forever to come from the kitchen and no they werent too busy and it was below average if youre looking for hometown food skip this place and head to lola s
really great place really good lunch specials enjoyed it every time i go we get the chicken korma and tikka masala won t disappoint fair price
i ve been here many times and have takeout food even more i ve tried most of the food here and they are always good the food here is on the saltier side that doesn t mean that it is not delicious the roasted pork is the best so far compared to other chinese restaurants in the area i love their customized noodle soup combo where you can choose your own soup base noodle topping and drink you can even add a small side dish for an additional cost i got the peanut soup based with thick noodle and sliced beef the portion here is huge and i can never finish it all by myself
ordered via uber eats had the carbonara i was glad they had lunch portions the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the flavour was amazing it got super greasy at the bottom but how can i complain when i knew it was a mix of bacon and cheese mmmm still thinking about it now we also ordered the margherita pizza which i heard was kinda underwhelming i didn t try this though i was too satisfied with the pasta
southern deliciousness i went with a group of about people and we were seated in less than minutes on a monday evening the restaurant itself is really chic and cute with a rustic look their lights were made with hanging mason jars it was very cute we ordered our food family style so that came with two large servings of the chicken and we ordered extra sides too we also ordered extra biscuits which came with this amazing apple jam and the biscuits were served hot and fresh we also had a mac n cheese side along with french fries the mac n cheese was my other favorite side i definitely recommend the mac n cheese the french fries were also good and crisp but there wasn t anything particularly special about them we also ordered a side of deviled eggs they were plated very nicely and tasted just as good the best part is probably the chicken the chicken was battered and deep fried perfectly i really like the seasoning because it was flavorful and has a kick to it they also give you a lot of hot sauce and other sauces on the side to drench your chicken in their hot sauce is a must their food is a little pricey but i think it s worth the splurge if you want a good southern meal in vegas
over rated nasty dirty seafood is not fresh the counters are dirty it s better quality seafood at rio carnival you pay less and the counters are maintained
it s been a few months since i first tried tokyo lobby so i will do my best to remember the highlights it s a bit out of my way so i ve only yet to go one time but i could only take so much <unk> and <unk> and pushing from my coworker who kept whining i want tokyo lobby until i finally said ok shut up we are going this instant the thing that stood out the most was the friendly staff when my friends and i walked in the employees all greeted us with a friendly shout suddenly i m norm from cheers the sushi was excellent i m still kind of a sushi noob but as a person who doesn t really care for fish i have to say it was quite impressive the texture was just right not too chewy and not too squishy i believe what i had was called a glendale roll baby lobster and stuff rolled up battered and fried to a crisp delicious nothing like good sushi cooked to order yes it s ironic on purpose i think all food should be battered and fried if you see a restaurant in the future called the battery then odds are i ll be running the place at the time of my last visit there was a new location being built closer to the road on the opposite end of the parking lot i m assuming this is to accomodate more customers as tokyo lobby was teeny tiny inside maybe it s to further distance the restaurant from the walmart a few doors down i say good on you tokyo lobby walmart sucks as of right now i don t know if it s open yet but hopefully it will be soon excellent place and i would recommend it to anyone with an appetite for sushi edit i asked my coworker today about the status of the new building and he says it s open i like <unk> points
had a fantastic meal on the patio at mr chow on a thursday evening the weather was fantastic it was a great night to dine al fresco they have ala carte ordering but most people order a tasting menu this is what we did there were four of us and for our mains we went with the crispy duck ma mignon whitefish and lamb shank for our appetizers we had the prawn toast dragon shanghai dumplings and mr chow noodles the wine list is decent enough and you ll probably find something that s up your alley but i would say it s on the lower end of the spectrum for a strip restaurant of the appetizers my favorite was the prawn toast crispy and prepared perfectly it was probably the favorite of the table the dumplings were next they had some fantastic broth and pork i wish we had ordered more of these i think they came or to an order the mr chow noodles were likewise strong but didn t do as much for me as the toast and dumplings of the entrees the duck was the <unk> winner as many other yelpers note it had fantastic crispy skin and was tender and moist i d have to give it some thought but probably a top or duck i ve ever had the entire table loved it we probably could have finished off another one had they brought it to us the drunken fish was poached in wine it was very moist not close to being overcooked the seasoning was subtle but there it was probably my least favorite but again it was a strong dish my second favorite entree was the ma mignon cooked to a perfect medium rare this was a very tender steak and i loved the sauce were i to return i would definitely re order the duck and steak the lamb is served on the bone and like the duck was moist and seasoned very well i have had better chinese meals jasmine at bellagio for example but this was a very strong meal in a great atmosphere service was fantastic too i would say the food is probably stars but the ambiance evening and overall experience bumps it up to stars give this place a shot and ask to sit on the patio
a few good options for greasy food but not my favorite dive bar in lakewood i got three oz drafts and a decent amount of food for the deep fried cheese and mac bites were actually delicious and i can see myself stopping by for a late night snack after a few drinks but i don t think i ll end up there too often
i haven t been to the flats in thirty five years thirsty dog brought us back we traveled from toledo to meet the in laws for lunch we don t get a lot of thirsty dog in toledo but they have a great reputation their beer is great the restaurant had maybe to choose from especially like the stouts and porters food was also very good i had the kielbasa and pierogis my wife had the meatloaf we had pretzels as an appetizer which is a must apple fritter for dessert which was decent
wow came in because of a bogo ad but i am sure to be back portions are oversized but more importantly food is seasoned beyond good as a matter of fact i want to try everything on the menu now and bring the rest of my family too
food we had the summerlicious menu nice plating generous portion and good taste value lunch summerlicious menu was an excellent value ambience modern and clean service not sure whether the waitress was discriminating against people who order summerlicious plus against people who don t order wines but she has never refilled our water without us asking her first twice she took our plates without asking us whether we were finished with our plates twice both times we were actually still working on them total of for two summerlicious lunch was the bill again great value i put a dollar bill and waited for the waitress here is the conversation waitress <unk> do you need change me umm yes please what do you think do you think i will tip after ordering summerlicious waitress how much do you want back me um waitress do you want the exact change back me yes please waitress or you can just tell me how much you need back me um ok let s see you can give me back i decided not to tip her well due to her abrupt and aggressive way of asking for tip waitress oh ok but i have to give you with lots of changes is that still ok me um sure what other options do i have not getting the change back waitress oh ok here is two four six eight ten eleven and twelve me thanks waitress yep on the other hand the gentleman who served us the pizza was very professional and friendly i think he might be the owner as a whole even though i really liked the food the value and the ambience of this place i am not sure i would go back anytime soon due to the serivce and aggressive attitude of the waitress <unk> ps look if you are going to discriminate against people who go there for the summerlicious deal without ordering drinks why don t you just write a note on the menu saying if you order the summerlicious menu you better add a drink to it or even easier just don t participate in the summerlicious my two cents nick
bad experience serving bad pieces of cold chicken that are not properly cut cold black beans and with cold chunks of rice balls i would encourage for those considering eating here to inspect what you put into your mouth before you waste your money
i want to start by saying this used to be my favorite place my husband found a baby cockroach in his sushi roll last night and quickly ran to show our server manager they said ew and gave us cent discount i know mistakes happen but a bug in our food so gross i m so mad our sushi spot is now ruined for date night the fact that we had to pay for our full meal is crazy my husband even said regardless if there was a bug he still would have gone back if the customer service was better they handled this situation very badly
i went here for dinner with my boyfriend and two friends we all really enjoyed it a lot my friend ate his mac and cheese burger so quickly that i almost forgot they even brought it out i had a burger and it was seriously awesome the donkey sauce is delicious and i only wish i could have finished that burger because it was so damn good the drinks were good but a little weak for my liking the flavors in them are great and very pronounced but it was hard to tell if they were weak or just that the flavors overpowered the alcohol i really like the decor as well as the sugar <unk> napkins and nice cutlery i would definitely hit this spot again on my next vegas trip and will look into trying one of guy fieri s other spots too
petit caf tr s sympathique au centre ville de toronto au <unk> du parc clarence avec sa terrasse <unk> e plein sud et un int rieur tr s convivial le neuf caf est <unk> de king west et spadina deux pas du <unk> la propri taire des lieux est une femme <unk> et chaleureuse par son accueil et son personnel est sympathique et avant tout <unk> <unk> donc y prendre un caf et d <unk> les p tisseries ici on ne <unk> pas avec la qualit
i stop in here for a hot drink before my hair appointments over at <unk> they have a great tea selection and the best mexican cocoa i ve ever had the place is honestly so hip it hurts and the <unk> don t seem to smile much but i m not exactly looking for an experience i just want something tasty and warm if you re into super organic and non gmo everything this place is certainly for you they have a pretty good looking food menu that i ll have to make a point to try sometime but seriously get the mexican cocoa
amazing hospitality and even better food the owner was so friendly and very attentive she made my boyfriend and i feel so welcomed everything that we ordered came out in reasonable time the presentation of each dish was so precise and well done the food was prepared very well and everything was fresh the owner offered us complimentary matcha ice cream house made and i have to say it was probably the best matcha ice cream i have ever had very happy with my experience here i will definitely be stopping by if i m ever in nevada again
delicious food at reasonable prices has my family coming back over and over again i usually order the massaman and thai iced tea they do charge for extra rice which <unk> me because they <unk> three adults to share one scoop of rice but whatevs the service is fast even when it is busy
passed by this food cart one day and had to stop by to try it out it was located on west <unk> street by <unk> museum the owner was nice and allowed me to make a combo of the chicken curry and <unk> beef meatballs typically you only order of each that comes with rice she was out of the <unk> <unk> or leek filled turnovers which i really wanted to try between the two entree items i liked the chicken a lot more than the <unk> it was more flavorful and the flavor was stronger the kofta tasted good but not as powerful of a flavor i assume afghan food is not spicy but i sure wish it were i d stop by again if it were in a more convenient location
typical las vegas steakhouse service was great though our server seemed stretched thinly over all the people the order filet mignon medium rare new york strip steak medium rare pacific halibut crab cakes heart of palm salad baked alaska birthday cake the filet is excellent perfectly cooked you get sauce and a small <unk> potato with it the steak breaks apart in your mouth just leaving your tongue with sublime juices the ny strip steak is tougher and bigger not bad but not a filet the pacific halibut was delicious large portion flaky fish with creamy sauce crab cakes were decent you get per order the heart of palm salad was amazing served with a side of greens and vinaigrette complimentary birthday baked alaska happy birthday dad
my friend wanted to have her birthday dinner at the artisan hotel since she has heard so many eclectic and wonderful things about it when we arrived we discovered that a graduation party has <unk> much of the space however upon walking into the mood restaurant everything was beautifully set for us everyone from the valet the manager the chef i mean everyone was so gracious and accommodating none of us could believe it good service is a difficult find these days and this place is tops our waiter ren was outstanding how he managed to <unk> serve the graduation party about new <unk> and still not miss a beat for our party of i don t know a true pro in both service and demeanor complemented by a dynamic support staff that kept us in stitches all night if you are a party of or more and it is your birthday they provide you with a complementary bottle of <unk> vodka complete with choices of mixers all of us left with disbelief having been given red carpet service throughout i highly recommend a visit we will be back for certain
cozy environment coffee and tea made to order semi friendly staff sometimes they can be aloof or have a too cool for you attitude great tea selection and delicious coffee drinks a bit on the pricier side but you pay for quality haven t tried the food but heard it s good
wow the trip down the stairs takes you to a delightful dining experience the bar and dining room are lovely it feels like a bar restaurant in chicago with that timeless kind of atmosphere the owners are right there to greet you years of providing fine dining and each employee is a delight we had two servers to provide our every wish scott and toni beverages they were wonderful and now the food delicious and delectable there were four of us and we each ordered something different all of the food was fabulous and i mean fabulous highly recommend
food was the worst i ve ever had the vegetables were cold and gummy which i asked to be taking back and reheated the chicken was <unk> and cold the chicken vegetables was tasteless only thing i did like were the spring rolls thankfully we had enough cash to pay the bill we never were informed it was cash only
monday s this is the place to be they have pints the food is pretty tasty too i frequent this place a handful of times a month especially on a monday
amazing southern indian cuisine ryan was fantastic and provided exceptional service and great recommendations their butter masala is delicious could not stop eating it best indian food in cleveland
we were looking for a new place to try around the area and we happened to this place we got the family dinner plan for the four of us and for the price it was definitely worth it the food was good and we would definitely come back
good donuts but you d better go early before they run out weekends in a row and they had no donuts left considering that they close at you would hope this doesn t happen especially on the weekend once you fool me
came back to woo che recently on a friday after we thought the price was more reasonable compared to sura well i was wrong because we were charged per person that night when we first walked in the door the place was almost deserted there were only one other table people beside when we left we noticed only one more group came in after us and basically they were the only one there after we left this is depressing for a late friday night dinner joint once we started eating the food we realized why the place was almost empty there weren t a lot of choices in term of food when compared with sura most of the cooked food have been sitting out for a long time and didn t look fresh the meat quality was low and again looked like it has been sitting out for a while overall the food experience were not good the service was nice but again it could be because there were only a few people there i felt bad for them because this place looks like it will have to close shop soon i don t think you can maintain a business when only a few people dined at your joint on a friday night i hope i m wrong and they will be successful again so that way sura don t have the <unk> and keep <unk> up the price
went there several weeks back and had an terrible experience that still hasn t been resolved when we showed up there was confusion with the hostess several people were there but none greeted us once we finally got their attention after asking to be seated it didn t get any better we asked for water and they brought out three glasses for our table of six twice throughout dinner i asked for a glass and they still never brought one out my fiancee didn t receive the correct order either the only saving grace was that the food was very good despite the terrible service i d love to give the benefit of a doubt but the restaurant wasn t even busy it was honestly one of the worst examples of service i ve ever received to add insult to injury they incorrectly charged me for a beer i ve call the restaurant six times now and it still hasn t been resolved i was waiting for it to get corrected before writing the review but it s apparent that they aren t going to take care of it if you re considering going here i would suggest another restaurant there s plenty of other options where the staff actually cares about their patrons
for a place that prides itself on sandwiches their bread arguably the most important part of the sandwich is just outright terrible i gave up flavorless and <unk> <unk> in like rd grade if you want a real sandwich that is made for adults with taste buds go to dibella s i do like the beer selection though and the fries are pretty decent so stars
burgers are huge but the flavor is just average better than fast food mega joints but not as good as five guys also very expensive the fries were so so the milkshakes were very good i ll go back one more time to see if it s any better once they ve settled into this new store but they are not very impressive right now
good burgers good bar food
took me years to come here lived here all my life seen it driving by the heard about just never went until yesterday really cool rustic atmosphere lots of old school memorabilia inside food was pretty damn good the steaks were on point i got the oz porter which was amazing wife got the oz rib eye which was equally good kids had fish and chips and bbq beef tips from the kids meal which was pretty good sized the crab cakes were pretty darn good too overall a nice hole in the wall
stars i miss this place so much it is the best italian shop anywhere near charlotte and the only reason it s not a is because it s so tiny and thus gets really busy on the weekends when everyone comes by to pick up their favorite treats it can also be very pricey for some item considering they re uncooked but you definitely get the best quality meats out there they sell everything you can think of from marinated cuts of all kinds of meat about different types of a la carte vegetable side dishes various pastries and even homemade gelato there is also a nice large wall section full of only italian wines and they do weekly specials with in store free tastings i got some of the best steaks i ve ever grilled here and by far the best prosciutto i have ever eaten the <unk> here are also made fresh daily and are absolutely delicious and loaded with creme there s also a cute little patio area if you want to come by and have a fresh made deli sandwich but just be warned there are only about tables so you may not get a seat also the hours are short most days so if you re running late you may want to call ahead and be sure they re still open
a fun vibe good music happy people yummy margaritas and food chips and salsa were good ordered chicken fajitas and beef tacos fajitas were better than the tacos but no complaints
where to begin a gem of a place on the strip literally i would never go back to vegas without revisiting this restaurant as a main we shared the fried chicken which was the perfect texture and some of the finest fried chicken this planet has to offer the only downside to this dish was it did not come with sides as an appetizer we ordered the brisket biscuit or was it biscuit brisket which i may have enjoyed more than any food ive tasted in the past decade the brisket was so good that we have decided to make biscuit brisket an everyday phrase i will say that the sides were mediocre at best the mac n cheese was nothing special the coleslaw is <unk> by an average diner the spiced watermelon <unk> it just was the brisket biscuit was good enough that the lack of decent side dishes was not something that i can remove a star for or if i did it would be from star anyway if your reading this and not going to eat dinner here thats ok just make sure to stop by and get some biscuit brisket to make life worth living that sh t was so good
i am very disappointed that we called for about mins and we thought that you were busy but we went there you we we closed when you were supposed to be open you broke my daughters heart
cool atmosphere inside this place nice indoor brick oven relaxing outdoor seating that had ample <unk> on the wrap around patio i ordered the rosemary potato pizza and added chicken to it while bryan my hubs ordered the meat lover s pizza being a meat lover myself i should ve known that the meat lover s pizza was particularly more tasteful and better than mine but mine was still good i used to love the rosemary chicken potato pizza at california pizza kitchen until it was sadly discontinued i was almost so upset that i <unk> from going to cpk for awhile i know silly reason but that s me i was looking to <unk> that need with the rosemary potato pizza here i really do believe that it s good but i felt the flavor could ve been stronger i barely could taste the rosemary in the pizza strangely <unk> i loved more than anything though was the pizza crust it just tasted wonderful and had the right texture to it this wonderful crust paired with the meat lover s pizza was sooo good so even though my own didn t wow me because i loved the meat lovers and because i want to try all the other huge varieties of pizzas here i will definitely return it d be cool if there could be a gigantic sampler pizza of all their specialty pizzas but i guess that would be kind of hard to accomplish now wouldn t it one can dream
this place seems to be getting a bad rap but really i thought it was pretty good my only complaint was how long it took to get our order out of the drive thru but it was a big order so i won t treat them too harshly prices could be a little lower but nothing too outrageous for a locally owned non chain burger joint they do have some clever menu items chorizo dog that my family enjoyed a lot their burgers were pretty good too it looks like they may have had some troubles early on but got them corrected my verdict is that they deserve an honest shot would return it s not bad
new buffet in the area and tried it out with my wife price is and includes access to a mongolian type grill sushi and the regular selection of asian buffet items like mongolian beef sweet sour chicken etc since the place is new its in good condition and customer service is decent the regular asian food was ok with some of the dishes being warm but most were cold the sushi selection was good for a place like this including the standard nigiri but rolls were a bit scarce when you wanted something that wasn t stuffed with raw fish they had plenty of desserts but they did not taste very good but looked nice in the presentation they also had ice cream albeit not self serve had to wait for someone to come by to scoop some for me after several minutes of the sever trying to scoop the hard ice cream i ended up getting what looked like half a scoop and a sorry that he couldn t scoop more i also noticed he did not wear gloves and his fingernails were dirty <unk> the mongolian grill had a good selection of items to grill but their sauces were lacking in choice i was only asked spiciness level and that was it the sauce was lacking in flavor but the items were cooked ok all in all a good place to try out once but i wouldn t be returning for the price
we ve been here for both breakfast and lunch and both were delicious the waitstaff is always friendly and full of great recommendations the nutella latte is super yummy so give it a try and right now they have a wonderful pumpkin soup go to shea
not the same mekong i know and loved i m in the process of moving from dormont so it seems fitting that mekong has new ownership got my usual chicken mekong noodle and spring roll they were out wish they wouldn t have changed the recipes
this is the third time in a few weeks that the night shift crew has conveniently closed a few hours early due to their servers being down this has happened too many times for it not to be reported to upper management for the issue to get fixed either <unk> or correcting human error seems this crew needs to learn math skills so they could at least take cash only when this occurs keep this up and your store will close so it better be worth it evening crew
i looooove sushi ordered the sampler and some of the rolls looked like they were falling apart and in fact they did purple rice was a cool touch tougher than your usual sushi rice reminded me of brown rice texture our sashimi appetizer sampler was pretty good and fresh ambience felt very welcomed when we first walked through the door cute decor cozy atmosphere other i am on the search for an inexpensive and fresh sushi place since i ve moved back to phoenix i d like to come back to try other rolls for sure obviously parking is not free since it s downtown but it was very inexpensive i paid for one hour right around the corner
this is usually my second choice to <unk> when i m too hungry to walk to st denis from the village it s definitely not the best banh mi in the city but at the end of the day it s comforting and filling enough for the price i will add that service is top notch and the place was clean every time i ve been in
patty provided me with exceptional service i needed help with a community fundraiser and patty quickly stepped up and <unk> to donate to my elementary school the three times i have eaten here i have had great service as well all employees have warm personalities and have provided great service my favorite thing on the menu was the <unk> onion and tomato jam flatbread it was amazing all in all i really like gm and i am glad they are apart of the chandler community
great hookah at a good price chilled environment with good service the hostess is on point
love popeyes but will never go back to this one this is one of the <unk> popeyes i have ever seen the tables pop <unk> area and the floor was filthy it made for a very <unk> dining experience
been here twice now michael is a great bartender the garlic park fries are out of this world never liked them before most of the crowd is laid back a few get too pretentious full of themselves but the staff is not that way look go check it out
overrated i admit i was stoked to come here after hearing coworkers telling me to come and all the shining reviews online it s almost an hour away but i braved the <unk> temperatures and traffic to try this out worth it absolutely not prices are high and portions are tiny i got the <unk> french toast dish with thin dinky slices of spicy sausage this was already and i was not full or impressed the french toast slices were thin and unseasoned without the syrup the menu claimed it was butter maple syrup but those are lies i just got a tin cup with regular cheap syrup hubby ordered the <unk> crepe but was afraid the portion would be too small so added eggs on top he said the taste was good but it was way too dry it claimed to have bechamel sauce but definitely not enough i commented that the only authentically parisian element about this place were the bathrooms the door actually <unk> against the toilet seat this is all the room you get i m critical because i ve had delicious crepes in paris and not only are they not very pricey they are a <unk> buttery taste that is lost on this poor substitute in the us it was dim stuffy crowded and run down or hipster style i would not recommend this place or go back myself give me first watch or ihop any day
i love this place they have the best steaks in town they serve oz rib eyes and porterhouse steaks that just makes you want to visit this place whenever you are in town the sides they serve are just as fantastic their mac and cheese along with their cream spinach will guarantee your return this place is a must stop if you are visiting the the m resort and casino
new owner for a few years has really made a difference in this place the decor is much cleaner and nicer the food is even better than it was and now it has wings our family favorite they are delicious also sandwich s are still fantastic and the pizza has been upgraded in a big way love this place to come with the family and just have a great time
there are tons of places in town for tapas from different cuisines but this is the first mediterranean version i ve found pick five get one free can be a great deal if you pick carefully definitely get the eggplant salsa props for having several vegetarian and vegan options staff are what make this place and owner ab was super friendly throughout my visit and even gave me some extra dessert treats their baklava here is unique in that it s less sweet and more nutty i dig it but my favorite mediterranean dish will always be chicken shwarma the version here is heavily seasoned a good thing available in a plate or wrap plate comes with a good side salad and a hefty portion of hummus my only wish is that they include garlic sauce as that is what really makes the seasonings of the dish sing
kind of a long wait usually a good sign was well worth it phenomenal food excellent service and a bakery to die for plan on putting on some weight it was my first time here but whenever i go back to vegas i will always find my way here
dog <unk> <unk> me yeah buddy let s go out and grab a few bites how about that dog yeah i m down me what did you say dog x there is a restaurant where you can enjoy a few drinks and bites while your k companion can enjoy some food too talk about a cute place to hangout after the dog park with your friends setting it is in <unk> right by las vegas blvd near the flemings and bonefish the place is <unk> and the patio area for the dogs is well spaced out right when you walk in it smells like a new home had been built since it s only been open for days but as long as it doesn t smell like dog i ll come back drinks pretty standard choices for drinks and a happy hour we went on wednesday and hh was pm close some bites from to bud light coors light for a oz and drafts food we got the poke jar which made my hawaiian native friend spin it was a jar with sour cream guacamole bits of tuna on the top so a little texmex hawaiian fusion going on it actually wasn t that bad check in on yelp for free cajun fries that are served in a huge bag the burger was for hh but the patty meat was soooo thin service the gentleman that served us in the patio was fantastic i can t remember his name but he was much better than the first server we started out with he accommodated the friends that came in two by two and split the bill with no trouble he was thin tall and had some hair on his face overall a cool spot for dog lovers and friends to come hangout i can t say their happy hour beats <unk> but it was okay
food was good took minutes to take drink order and another to bring it service was very poor and slow if you have a short time before flight go somewhere else
i absolutely love this place here are my personal reasons they have nutella coffee that deserves stars alone they have great customer service they nearly always remember my husband s name since he is in there more often than i am you can call in your coffee order ahead of time what yes you really can this is an amazing thing take that starbucks they have great food and on tuesday nights you can get for a bottle of wine and bruschetta don t get me wrong i love postino s for this deal but this place actually has parking without the hassle you can bring your <unk> it seems like very few people take advantage of this they have bike racks for when we ride our beach <unk> over instead of walking it s walking distance cute patio with misters and fresh herbs growing all around the nutella espresso martini it s no longer on the menu or wasn t last time i was in but i ve asked and they ve still made it for me so <unk> if you aren t convinced yet stop reading this and just go try it out don t expect a huge menu or a large indoor seating area it s tiny and it s meant to be a great tiny local spot go when the weather is nice and sit outside while sipping a nutella martini and eating bruschetta if you re disappointed then i m not sure what to tell you
breakfast is delicious we ordered the brisket bagel with fried egg amazing also had an order of lox and bagels perfect service was fast and pleasant food was fresh and hot the coffee selections were great very clean restaurant bathrooms were spotless
this restaurant has a variety of crepes sweet or savory french toast and much more i had the posh panini it tasted great the ingredients were fresh the server s were quite friendly and the food came out quite fast all in all it great lunch and i would definitely return and recommend this place to others
wildly overpriced mediocre food smells like <unk> ass inside i ordered the coconut pancakes read pancake it came with one lumpy ass pancake with a side of bacon and my friend ordered the pineapple french toast the serving sizes were tiny for the prices we paid and the food was bland just go to the grocery store and pick up some frozen eggo toaster waffles and or pancakes and some <unk> bacon for a meal of the same quality and a fraction of the cost
the reason why i am giving this place two stars instead of two is because their sandwiches are good but they are very expensive i spent time in ca and in the east coast and i am not expecting east coast <unk> quality but the price does not really match the quality they are greedy and charge too much they should lower their prices across the board and of course they make their most money off of their drinks in fact they charge restaurant prices so do no think it is cheap their philly cheese steak is the best but i was kind of disappointed in their pastrami if you want those in a without any drinks or chips you are going to pay i would have given it a star honestly but i felt like thier food is not bad again it is better than subway at least they do not heat it in a microwave in la and nyc you can find good deli and they charge something reasonable like the portions will be the same but the quality will be better there are way better places you can co in lv for a good sandwich just hit up one of the casinos you do not have to gamble i wanted to give this place a shot because it is next to my house but i am not coming also sometimes it is very hard ot place an order and pick it up your phone does not go through they have problems with <unk> overall b quality on food but f on prices i have not tried all of their things because for i can go to the supermarket and get a couple of pieces of steaks i wanted to write a long review so people are aware of the issues do not say i did not warn you if you are not being served and you are picking up the food why should i pay you those prices and you expect a tip here is a tip do not be a fool stay in school lol the ambiance is your typical fast food joint but again they charge eatery prices
fantastic juicy burger perfectly soft artisan bun topped with all the options i wanted bacon carmelized onions crispy onions strings jalape o ketchup wow if that wasn t enough the homemade tater tots the size of marshmallows complemented perfectly hubby loved the potato skins and his burger topped with an egg bacon cheese this one is on the again list for sure don t be fooled by the simplicity of this place they put all their effort into making great food
i have been going to forte family practice for a few years now i have had no bad experiences until today they often have long wait times but that s expected if you decide to come to forte family practice do not see joe <unk> he <unk> me with <unk> a couple days ago gave me a few <unk> and said that i d be better and able to go back to work in a couple days was told that if i don t feel better in a couple days to come back well a couple days had passed and i felt the same and worse cuz i developed a fever the night before which i didn t have previously so i came back today he did not listen to anything i had to say argued with me about the fever i also asked for a dr note extending my time off from work he left the room but left the door open i could hear him outside the room talking <unk> about me then gave me a note saying i could return to work tomorrow i tried to explain i needed more time that i didn t have the strength to stand for hours and that i worked in the service industry and i couldn t be handing people food and drinks with congestion and coughing up <unk> he did not care and refused to extend my note he said he had more important things to worry about than my note there was a lot more detail about my visit with him that showcases how unprofessional <unk> and completely uncaring he is as a medical professional i think this is enough to show you to avoid treatment from joe <unk> i hope
<unk> s are wood and brick and comfortable in a manly man cave way they have lots of the requisite offerings of a good bar many different beers good cocktails drink specials sports contests <unk> it s really about the food it s all a notch above just about every bar in town the fish n chips fried chicken burgers award winning chile salads sides are all damn good and their breakfast menu is delish and a good deal too the o <unk> potatoes are sooo good
i ve passed by sushi samba many times but today i finally decided to try it out i had no idea that it was a japanese peruvian brazilian fusion cuisine the managers jason vivian took care of me very well everything that came out was explained in detail so i knew exactly what i was getting the sashimi was so fresh and everything in general was extremely flavorful i have never experienced something like this restaurant definitely would go back again thank you for the amazing service and delicious food
i came here last night to experience all that is green i was excited because i m trying to go on this less meat eating path and green is the perfect place to do so the setup is absolutely adorable with the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and car doors and the menu layout for all the tsoynamis is equally cute my friend and i got the wings to start the red diablo and the kung pao bowl the wings were really good and i love the dipping sauce they came with i was in heaven with my red diablo bowl i loved the consistency of the mock chicken and the eggplant had been soaked in sauce for a while so it was completely mushy just the way i like it i completely polished off my bowl and my friend did the same yet he was still craving the tsoynami since the guy at the counter gave us a free sample after going through all of our options at which point he decided we would never be friends again because i don t like coffee rootbeer or mint we decided on the rocky road tsoynami these things are huge and perfect to split with someone for an after dinner treat they definitely do not skimp on the toppings this place is perfect to get some flavorful vegetarian in and it s served at a pretty good price i definitely have to come back and check out the salads
we had the mahi mahi fish tacos they were amazing we both loved them the salsa is great and the atmosphere is very festive we will definitely be back
excellent service good quality fresh sashimi and questionable serving size when my chirashi was delivered it looked <unk> small while i was eating my meal i realized that the cuts of sashimi were very thin and small unusually so i was sitting at the sushi bar and there was a guy sitting a couple of seats away from me after i was done with my meal he asked me what i thought of it i said that i enjoyed it but did mention the sashimi size concern i had he replied saying that was his experience as well my grandmother used to say if enough people say it its got to be true grandma <unk> was a smart cookie it s unfortunate as this impacted an otherwise nice dining experience
so much fun i had never heard of this place but my boyfriend had and took me here didn t tell me it was one of those places where the servers are mean to you on purpose he just said i ll like it i did i love places like that they of course gave us the paper hats mine said harry potter makes me moist my boyfriend s said so small i pee on my balls it was fun reading other <unk> hats and having ppl laugh at ours they talk crap to you if catch you on your phone they make inappropriate jokes about the food they prob re use those lines so i won t tell you what they say lol don t want to kill your experience but they had us laughing we also got accused of watching porn when we both were looking at something on my phone haha good times i would come back
the food is amazing the atmosphere and service is even better i will be coming again soon
best irish sunday breakfast buffet in <unk> pricey adult but so worth it and one that certainly can lead one to sinful gluttony the irish sausage and the creamed salmon are the real deal polite attentive and yet not intrusive service five stars were the dessert selections a bit more interesting note to management if they re reading sherry trifle but truth be told you d have to be a <unk> or woman of truly <unk> appetite to feel the need for a closing course of sweet after a swoop on this buffet plan for a post <unk> hour or two to <unk> to reflection and digestion after a sunday morning at johnny fox s
good texmex food live close so easy for me good margaritas decent service prefer the local mexican places but this place is good and closeby upset that i don t get my work discount anymore but will return
my server mia did a phenomenal job on taking care of the customers in an <unk> manner while <unk> her team up front i m glad the manager took his time in hiring workers like her i will definitely be back at this panda for my next cuisine
we finally tried farmer boys and i m sorry to say it was a disappointment i give it stars because the people working there were truly nice especially <unk> h who was helpful guiding us through the menu and my lunch mate enjoyed the fried zucchini but the rest was rather ordinary
i have been here a few times the servers have always been good friendly and knowledgeable the food has been fantastic on every vist although a bit over priced for some dishes they have a great sunday brunch with a mimosa bar try the calamari and the rosemary fries
it really isn t bad for what it is i m currently <unk> down on one of the most bizarre and wonderful salads ever okay there s mac and cheese and some orange slices in here too and with a drink it cost just under word to the wise my roommate taught me the clever trick of getting a to go container cram as much shit in there as possible and try to shut the lid theory is this you probably couldn t eat it all in one sitting but you can <unk> it so you could squeeze meals out of it eating there promises a fat belly but no to go
ice cream the thing that makes you scream i scream the next thing ya know we re all just screaming at each other but in all seriousness i am not an ice cream fan if we were putting our love of ice cream into the <unk> in which we scream mine would be a quiet <unk> okie <unk> put a cone on it however made me scream with delight i popped in here with my super cool canadian cousin who lives a couple bus stops away from this establishment she had never been and we were both jonesing for a sweet ice cream in degree weather was not my first choice i digress what we ordered we split a three scoop cup and got earl grey pumpkin pie and matcha green tea wow the flavors of the the ice cream were so true to their real life counter parts it was alarming the earl grey especially was delightful it was like having the creamiest cup of tea the matcha was not over sweetened it still had that bitter <unk> of tea taste to it finally the pumpkin pie what can i say about this perfected flavor the spices were there the texture was phenomenal and i was a happy camper this place definitely deserves five stars the ice cream was not icy or hard just fresh and soft like you always want ice cream to be makes me sad this place doesn t exist in sunny california
this sugar factory sucks messed up my girlfriend and i s order and then messed it up again when they brought it out a second time don t come here stick to the sugar factory on the strip much better customer service
ordered delivery from <unk> and the quality of the food was good it was hot and it tasted fresh a little note about the delivery man though he expects a tip beforehand for the food which is really unprofessional of him
great pizza and friendly staff make this place a top notch spot to go along with the slices a drink deal that runs all day long
came here for a quick dessert on a thursday evening it s definitely no sit down but more like a grab and go kind of place ordered a scoop of their hong kong milk tea ice cream and was blown away by the flavour and the colour of it it tastes just like the milk tea you d be having at a hong kong cafe i m glad the ice cream tasted like milk tea and not just milk i find other places that try to make this flavour focus more on the texture of the ice cream than the actual flavour which is why i was impressed by the colour of it other places usually try to make the texture creamy which masks the true flavours will definitely be back to try some of their other flavours and their donuts which were introduced not too long ago after their recent renovation
i love the falafel wrap here the falafel aren t dry at all and they always accommodate my special requests
my first time being in a beach club and i had no idea what to expect my bf and i were first in line because i wanted to make sure that we got a place to sit i anticipated that this place would get super packed and a locker to store our essential personal items things to note renting a locker cost <unk> was the dj that day so the prices must ve been jacked up needless to say this was worth the money because once the place gets packed with hundreds of people it s tough to find your things and having a place to store your wallet cellphone change of clothes and other items was worth the peace of mind even though it does not say it on the <unk> list of items do not bring <unk> lotion they will <unk> it you are allowed the <unk> though additionally if you forget to bring or get yours <unk> you can always buy some from the towel window or go to the bathroom and use the items in there just make sure to tip the person or dollars as expected drinks and food are super expensive you re not allowed to bring anything in and there is no re entry once you re in so if you re going to be hanging around the pool for hours you are bound to get hungry we got a hamburger chicken fingers and a gatorade total cost that s like one entry to a buffet drinks on the other hand what and the most expensive alcohol they have is like <unk> vodka good for them for really making money although they are a bit heavy handed with their drinks i personally cannot drink alcohol if i can taste it and so to me it tasted like drinking <unk> but everyone else around me seemed to enjoy it seating i would highly recommend getting a table or a cabana with shade if you are in a big group the cheapest table is like k but it includes alcohol so if you divide that up amongst of you compared to the cost of the drinks it might be worth the money plus you have a set place to keep your stuff if you are like us who came just as a couple so k is just a ridiculous price to pay for two people there are places to sit around the palm trees just know that it gets so hot and there is not a lot of shade we were able to find a place to sit but unfortunately through the day we lost our shade and it just got hot we ended up spending most of the time in the pool there s no schedule of events we got there at people thought <unk> would be on at pm after they said pm he eventually started to dj sometime between and pm security i had both a good and bad experience with them first the good they actually go in the water and make sure that people are ok bad my boyfriend lost his flip flops or someone took them in the midst of the hundreds of people there i miraculously found mine after someone had taken it at the beginning of the day we asked the staff where we could buy new ones they directed us to the shops at the wynn we ended up going to the wynn and i felt really appalled at the security staff there mind you i was completely sober but because i happened to not be staying there during this time i am a red card member they literally blocked our entrance to come in because my boyfriend did not have <unk> which happened while we were on their property i tried to explain the situation and i said i could go in to buy shoes <unk> for him and my bf could wait for me outside but they were really rude and condescending and if you know me it takes a lot to get me upset and would not let me in either never in my life have i experienced this type of professionalism or lack there of and being in a service profession i never would ve treated anyone the way i was treated so if you don t stay at the actual hotel expect the security staff to be less than pleasant with you this problem would ve been avoided if the staff would ve told us to go to the mall across the street instead of directing us to the wynn atmosphere it was really nice coming in and it was empty but by pm it s so so crowded that i takes a long time to get out of the pool to get drinks or go to the bathroom so i pretty much stayed in the pool unless i really had to get out everyone s pretty nice and chill but once the drinks kick it it gets a little crazy there were a group of guys that kept throwing stacks of cash in the water also i met a group of people who my bf and i hung out with who were really friendly and cool also don t get intimidated that it s a pool party because you ll be out and about in your swim wear i know i was but everyone s out to have fun and once i let that go i had fun overall would i do this again ehhh it was probably a once in a lifetime thing unless i get a big group of friends to go and we get table cabana service i would rather chill at the pool with friends and family and have a stereo playing in the background
the last time i went here a few years ago a group of friends and i were eating and a cockroach fell from the ceiling onto the middle of the table not kidding fresh fish should not be ayce at all avoid
they dropped some menus at our building recently i noticed that they deliver which is great when you are stuck at home with a toddler and no car everything we got including lo mein general tso s egg rolls and fried wonton tasted great i wasn t expecting much more than convenience but i was pleasantly surprised the delivery guy and the girl on the phone were friendly and the food came quickly if you want some guilty pleasure food this is a good place for it
one of the highest rated restaurants in mississauga i thought it was time to give union social eatery a try let s just start by saying it did not dissapoint i made reservations for on opentable and upon arrival was led to a booth for the restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere what i would call classy casual started off with a bottle of malbec almond crusted chicken tenders and the smoky club flatbread to share the food took a while to come out but when it did it was perfection good portions hot and flavorful our fave was the chicken tenders just absolutely juicy on the inside and soo crunchy on the outside the two sauces that accompany it were very well done as were the fries the flatbread massive generous with the toppings and <unk> in flavours it was a dish that made my eyes and mouth happy after that we were pretty satisfied but being our piggy selves we went for the calamari which was alright we had planned to get mains but at this stage we were full up to our <unk> but just had enough room for dessert or so we thought we each got the warm mars bar brownie because who shares dessert omg it was a <unk> portion we changed up the ice cream and got the vanilla bean instead of the mint i don t know where they get there ice cream from but it s heaven i d have been happy with a scoop of it alone the brownie was super chocolaty and moist and was everything a dessert of this type is supposed to be i ended up taking the brownie home because i just could not get any more in overall the restaurant has a great atmosphere friendly service <unk> food and very reasonable prices our bill was with tips for apps and a bottle of wine which is quite reasonable will definitely be going back
awesome food after reading all the great reviews i wasn t sure if it would live up to to high expectations i m pleased to say it did the butter chicken roti was amazing so was the saag <unk> just melts in your mouth absolutely delicious the portions are large <unk> husband and i could finish a little over half of our rotis we also ordered <unk> which was just about ok we ll definitely go back for more roti though
true new york style pizza if you like this style of thin crust pizza you ll love adamo if you don t you won t pies are huge they hardly fit in the box three types on offer currently only takeout
delicious falafel wrap and amazing homemade hummus the people who work here are very friendly every time i go in highly recommend this place for great mediterranean food that s homemade and good for you
loud and chaotic very attentive manager but seemed to be understaffed everything was done at a very fast pace not a very relaxing atmosphere the <unk> were fine and the pizzas were big enough for two people but not all that tasteful if you were looking for a sit down italian meal and didnt want to get dressed up and get reservations this place will do fine
we have been to this place every time we have come to montreal and have never been disappointed this time around we came with our month old daughter and the servers were curious and wonderful in preparing food that she can eat as to the grown ups i highly recommend the lobster salad the seafood crepe and the duck <unk> we have yet to get anything we haven t enjoyed
of the many chinese spots in cu rainbow garden is definitely one of the nicer places for a good dine in experience since it s decorated better than most and the staff is on point the food is also pretty good and the portions are on the larger side to this day if i ever get a cold i get a craving for their egg drop soup
excellent food excellent service some staples no harm chicken parm <unk> poboy thyme fries my favorite place to hang out catch up on reading while enjoying the food and surrounding people and energy a nice break from the old town scottsdale crowd that is near where i live
last night we had a take out of butter chicken i ordered it as medium spice the butter chicken sauce tasted like sweet tomato sauce it reminded me of panera bread tomato soup it was that sweet tamarind used to have good delicious food i don t mind paying more for delicious food but their quality has gone down it s more expensive than other local establishment and food quality has degraded as well
after reading all of the positive reviews we were stoked all i can say after eating there is that people here in az have no ability to discern good food from food that is merely different the dining experience did not start out well the table had been wiped off after the previous diners but it was still greasy we ordered wine and the wine glasses had some film on them maybe from being <unk> in water that was not clean we ordered the calamari and greek fries as appetizers the calamari were very dry i had the feeling they were cooked earlier and kept warm the fries were pretty unique but the lemon sauce they were served on was waaaay too tart the biggest problem with the meal was when our entrees were brought to the table only minutes after we got the appetizers my husband s comment to the wait person was met with little more than a shrug although later on she did say that the kitchen had the food ready too quickly the entrees gyros sandwich chicken souvlaki greek salad with grilled chicken were just ok all of us felt that the food was not hot further supporting the thought that everything was prepared in advance and reheated the seasoning were nicely done however it s a safe bet we ll be looking elsewhere the next time we have a taste for greek food
this is my absolute favourite thai restaurant in the gta i have eaten here at least x and have yet to have a questionable experience the service is warm and friendly the prices are reasonable kind of cheap actually and the food is incredible my favourite dish is the peanut chicken curry which is a bit like red curry but even better it s one of the friday specials but the cool thing about this place is that for an extra dollar or two you have have the specials on the days when they aren t specials if that makes sense always be sure to specify that you want veg in your curry b c sometimes it comes with just meat weird but whatever
totally completely and utterly amazing this is a must for any trip to vegas stand dead center facing the bellagio prepare yourself note if it is windy they may cancel this show this runs every minutes
this could be one of the best meals of my life the staff was friendly and attentive the ambience was phenomenal they had old de la soul tribe called quest and jazz playing the herbs were taken straight from the pots under a light on the bar they drinks were creative now the food ridiculous so good no need to say more one seating a night so no rush great night
this is one of the better steaks i ve eaten i ordered the filet mignon and the meat was so tender that the name is really appropriate also a plus that you can mix what kind of sauce and vegetables you want yourself the downside was the price on the restaurant which was kinda expensive also we had to wait some time to get our food but this was accepted since we were a party of
i am so happy that the cleveland area finally has an indian fast casual restaurant i loved this place probably because i m indian it s not as good as some of the more authentic indian restaurants but it definitely is close i ordered the paneer plate with naan rice and tikka masala the food was spiced well although not too strongly so it s not overwhelming the portions are appropriate i felt i had enough to be full but not too much where i left with a stomach ache my husband enjoyed his chicken as well i can t wait to try the chai next time i also enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant it s clean modern and also has some unique features such as the long table with books hanging underneath the coolest thing is the hand washing <unk> ll know what i m talking about once you try it the staff were so friendly and i enjoyed being able to see the kitchen through the glass windows this west <unk> will definitely be trekking back to the east side for some choolah
ordered <unk> kabab daal mixed lentils and a boneless chicken biryani was told it would take mins so i told the lady that we would like to have the <unk> kabab while we waited totally ignored my request and i let it go because there were people after me standing in line <unk> kabab was a little on the spicy side for me the boneless chicken biryani they got wrong so check your order before leaving the store called the store to complain and guy that answered doesn t understand english lady that he put on said they would make good on next visit but wouldn t give her name biryani tasted better than the one i ve eaten from silver spoons large portion of mainly rice we were too full after the <unk> kabab and the large portion of chicken biryani we put the lentils away for tomorrow s dinner and we still have leftover rice
my husband and i sat at the bar over memorial day weekend to have a few beers the female bartender was accommodating and nice enough we were having a generally good time until my husband got up to use the restroom while i was sitting alone i <unk> upon seeing this a random male server made an offensive and racist remark about the size of my mouth yawn and how it <unk> with the color of my husbands skin the gentlemen sitting across from me were in just as much shock at the comment needless to say i will not be returning lucky for that server i didn t share this with my husband until we were a safe distance from the casino
given its limited space narrow open kitchen and minimal menu layout buldogis is what i d imagine a restaurant would be like if a working gourmet food truck backed into a shopping center unit and never left if that was the desired effect then i must applaud these guys on a job well done jokes aside though this place is probably one of my favorite places to eat in the city whenever i m in the mood for the <unk> most rich most decadent greasy wonderful feast i could possibly <unk> up in my <unk> desires whenever i want to have a meal that not only fills my stomach but makes me happy to be alive i come here it s got a fast food vibe a menu <unk> from familiar junk food items but your food will take a good minute to prepare that s because the ingredients are fresh the sauces are hand crafted and each meal is made to order buldogis puts a unique spin on american classics like hot dogs hamburgers and fried chicken they offer an impressive list of gourmet dogs all of which can be made into burgers my favorites are the angry dog spicy pork asian slaw jalape os spicy mayo and the santa fe dog hot link chili cheese pico de gallo chipotle mayo unfortunately for my waist line i can t come here without ordering a side of specialty fries my favorites are the carne asada fries the best i ve ever had and euro fries pork belly cheddar garlic mayo herbs these are must try items and i d say if you get nothing else try these they also have great chicken strips and chicken wings well fried not greasy at all who would have guessed a hot dog place would be so great at frying chicken the hangover soup is another must try it will clear your sinuses guaranteed if you like spicy food i recommend ordering a side of dragon sauce it s a unique asian inspired hot sauce that i can t get enough of
the food is amazing and very well served try the fried avocado the fajitas and the <unk>
we tried this a couple of days after going to the aria buffet and were really surprised it didn t give aria more competition soft serve ice cream instead of gelato bellagio seriously soft serve there were bananas foster not superlative and very nice creme brulee one of our favorites the prime rib was very good as was the au jus the crab legs and shrimp were good but standard fare the sushi selection was rather disappointing especially compared to aria the <unk> were few and far between there was an excellent selection of picture perfect fresh fruit and a nice garnish bar with olives and nuts included in contrast the bread was below lackluster at aria i actually was tempted into two selections at bellagio it was easy to skip breads completely the soups were boring and not at all tempting even though there were several selections available i kept wandering around thinking i might have missed something but no i had not my first glass of lemonade was fine the next one was watery the replacement wasn t very good either oh well go to aria instead
on balance it was really nice the room was big the gym was nice the service was good the whole casino smelled of smoke but that s pretty much everywhere in vegas i also hate paying resort fees and they nickel and dime you on little things like early check in and printing out boarding passes but i ll definitely stay there again
the food is tasty but the service is impossibly slow bring a snack to eat while you wait for your food if you re hungry the serves actively avoided our table as we tried to wave them down to get the status of our food that took more than an hour overall this meal was not worth the wait
i ve been to kyoto several times and its one of the best places in vaughan to grab high quality sushi at a more than reasonable price it s a very popular restaurant in vaughan that has always been packed to the brim with people when i ve sat to eat the seating is slightly cramped there s a lot of ambient conversations in the air but not so much so that you can t carry on your own conversation the servers are plentiful and are quick with service i have always had a high quality of fish when i ve dined here recently i would say that the sushi rollers are being put to work with all the customers so on my last two occasions in dining here my sushi has been rolled loose however having said that the meal is always fantastic all in all great sushi in vaughan that i will continue to frequent enjoy
went in to get the advertised deal and was told they didn t have it will never go back again even though we settled for the regular pizza i don t like pepperoni so i guess it s now pb j for me called the manager who offered something free next time but there won t be a next time
if i could give stars i would i recently dined in at the sparklings for lunch i ordered a chicken sandwich and subbed mayonnaise for pesto from the lunch menu and when it came to the table it was covered mayonnaise i told the server and she apologized and took it back to the kitchen when she came back to the table she brought the same sandwich and placed it back on the table and brought a side of pesto i specifically asked is this the same plate and sandwich she said ya the chef isn t going to remake it so i brought a side of pesto honestly i couldn t believe the customer service and lack of responsibility that this restaurant displayed i don t usually write reviews but for the pure principle of the service that sparklings demonstrated i will not return there regarding your rude and dismissive response i think your comment further confirms what i have expressed you may think that the behavior your staff displayed is justified through your response however that is also incorrect in addition to the lunch order we also had dessert and coffee clearly your priority is purely <unk> it s evident that your <unk> approach to a business is why you are never busy and unable to handle or accommodate costumer requests
this review is about months late this place is totally worth going to for an amazing breakfast experience i m always craving a different style of breakfast food since i don t have time for a proper sit down meal bagels cereals bacon eggs pancakes etc nothing wrong with those but after a while they get boring enter the yolk a cozy little restaurant that my friend and i missed looking for lol intimate atmosphere and the most satisfying menu selection of breakfast foods we sat with some nice people at the long community table and had interesting conversations while digging into some exceptional dishes this place has no wifi or many private booths tables but i loved the community table good food and good conversations always go together they have meat and vegetarian options i myself had the <unk> barn hash with delicious root veggies eggs and a kick ass hollandaise sauce i can t remember what my friend had but we also shared the tn fries which were addictive i can t wait to go back and try something else
little ladies sitting in the back of a renovated gas station <unk> <unk> at the top of a hill making pierogies and cooking them to perfection in butter and onions it almost sounds like a strange pittsburgher fairy tale but this is no tale the finest pierogies i ve ever eaten emerge from the back of that gas station and my polish girlfriend even confirmed that these are better than some of her family s goods while in line i met folks from <unk> island kentucky and north carolina who all had come to mckees rocks in their rental cars straight from the airport before even going to see their families that is dedication and commitment to some seriously delicious pierogies after enjoying a dozen of these filling savory perfect pierogies i think once i move away from here i will be making that same trip to pierogies plus myself
one of my casual pho joints when i m working and feel the need to get some hot soup in my belly as usual with my restaurant downtown i usually come here around am to ensure there is plenty of seating for my co workers and i to gobble on that delicious pho i love the taste of the broth here and a regular size should suffice for most people if you feel like you haven t eaten in ages then i would recommend the larger size but be warned don t order appetizers as the size of the large <unk> large if you do get the regular size i would also recommend getting a side order of spring rolls as well i love their spring rolls my only gripe with this place is the kind of beef they use in their pho as i like the usual kind and this is more like a brisket or something it doesn t take away from the taste but it does make it seem not like home
overpriced undercooked looked like cooks threw handful of uncooked arugula on top of soggy sauce less crust
the pretzel fondue is terrific also recommend the turkey bbq sandwich i ve been to this restaurant a few times and the only concern i have is that it gets too busy while it s great to see a business thrive i find the staff sometimes doesn t know how to handle the amount of business it has more help might do the trick
i saw the reviews and had to try this place yes it s in a gas station parking lot but it s really nice and clean the only thing that was strange was that i saw online that they were open at i got there right at and there were about people already waiting outside for them to open i decided to wait in line because i figured they would open soon but they didn t open til about luckily the service was really fast and the food was definitely worth it the tacos are loaded the enchiladas are delicious burrito is good and filling rice is fluffy and flavorful the sauce is amazing the salsa is good but could be spicier next time i m gonna try something else you can t beat their prices either
to be honest i eat at restaurants all over the world and mainly the usa i had the worst customer service experience i have ever had anywhere that wasn t a mcdonald s i get more attentive service from a fast food cashier than the arrogant waiters at this establishment if you are reading this yelp review only go to brasserie if you want to pay absurd money to feel inferior have mediocre food and customer service that was only existent after we called over a manager he had to personally bring our food over for something to be done don t come here
honestly one of the best places to have butter chicken the other menu options are amazing as well the price is really good and it s a good place to go if you re in groups
this is a dandy little italian deli grocery that s highly satisfying and interesting they have great soups salads sandwiches pizzas pastas and other delicious things orders are taken at a counter and piping hot food comes to the table in a rush in mouth watering fashion tables are available indoors and outdoors with grocery shelves loaded with many italian food treasures locals and travelers go to defalco s and deservedly so this place is a gem not to be missed on a trip to scottsdale
pros great brunch food options friendly staff cons restroom outside of buffet old decor high price with underwhelming dessert option maybe put the deep fried <unk> at the dessert station
good sandwiches fancy type bread not a large selection for the kids ice cream seems okay if not outstanding reasonably quick and friendly service more affordable than some of the other options in the area
great little ale house with a nice selection of sandwiches it s a converted house set up just off of th street they serve fresh salads and some snacking type foods as well the beers however are the stars in my book good selection of craft beer bottles with a handful on draft the best priced happy hour craft beers that i have found for any draft they will usually rotate one or two of the handles based on the season and switch up the styles every now and then if you miss the happy hour times don t <unk> bottle selection is wonderful as well the sandwiches provide a nice complimentary roll ha a nice selection of different meats and combinations as well as temperatures they stay local with a schreiner s coney dog they get creative with their cashew butter and jelly with banana sandwich and my favorite is the acapulco cheesesteak ultimately a locally owned place with great beer fresh and local food and fair prices in a cool atmosphere
after reading some reviews about i had to give it a try i m glad i did i had the caramel and chocolate waffles with a order of pork belly the waffle was fire cooked to perfection and the pork belly i thought i was in the south this will be in my vegas rotation
every time we eat at blue the food and customer service is great but this past week they went above and beyond we had a person in our party who has celiac disease can t have cross contamination of gluten and when i spoke to chris the manager he assured us he would personally oversee the meal to make sure he ate safely he went over what was safe on the menu spoke to our waiter and made sure it was all ok it was a huge relief and the food was delicious as always thank you blue and chris

we had read all of the good reviews for this place and we finally had a chance to try it the only reason i am not giving it five stars is because they seemed to be ginger averse in my opinion which is odd for a thai restaurant we went for lunch and we were happy to see they had a nice crowd we definitely want this place to do well and stay open the thai options in ballantyne are meager my wife had the pad see ew and it was very tasty i had the panang curry which was also very tasty but had no ginger in it ginger would have made that dish really pop i also got the tom ka gai chicken coconut soup which is my measuring stick for any thai restaurant if your tom ka gai is good you have won me over theirs was good but lacked ginger and lemon grass and they put a fist full of whole cilantro on the top the cilantro really made the soup tasty but it was gone in the first spoonful my advice would be to add ginger and lemongrass to the tom ka gai and chop the cilantro and onions for the soup onion pieces were really large otherwise the chicken pieces were large and tender and the overall flavor was above average i would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves thai or is on the fence about it the bonus is they also have sushi there so if you are thai averse and all of your friends want to go there you can get sushi and everyone will leave happy edit we had take out from bahn thai for the night before thanksgiving these folks are so nice i d go back there just because they were so friendly and helpful with my large order additional dishes you need to try based on our new experience pud <unk> <unk> really spicy i got it a little extra spicy and wow was it good gaeng <unk> wang if you like a green curry my wife loved it
i m confused i m sitting here in bed after having drinks and dinner there tonight while the bumbleberry beer was good and the server was friendly i probably wouldn t go back the food just wasn t good and i m generally put off by large portions it s not funny or appetizing watching lb people gorge themselves on sandwiches the size of their heads made of subpar ingredients with amazing markets and options for purchasing meat in this city maybe i just expect better the smokehouse wings had very little meat on them and were cold by the time i got through of them my friend s hamburger looked like prison meat we all ended up bloated and none of us actually even came close to finishing our meals the atmosphere reminded me of the walmart of breweries get some character or something sigh i really wanted to like this place
hidden gem really good omelets fast on service and few tables will come back again
i returned to pittsburgh and was in the mood for some downtown sushi decided to give no sushi another shot and was very satisfied the lady remembered me and offered me my meal on the house to make up for the last time overall very happy with the food and service and my faith in them is restored
no lie these are probably the best fajitas i ve had outside of cali it might even be better than cali everything is so fresh i love how they serve roasted onions and jalapenos with the salsa and bean dip hubby had chile colorado and it was delish i had the scallops and shrimp dish can t remember its name and it was amazing but something about those flaming fajitas keeps me coming back and the house margaritas are awesome service is always on point we re going back tonight and my mouth is already watering
this place is filthy inside if you want to wash your hands you have to get a code for bathroom door from front staff the food is so over salted
place rules perfect actually the burgers on thursdays are awesome pinball machines good food good live music with a <unk> the size of a bathtub people with class which keeps the pbr <unk> out of my face try to criticize this place you ll look like a <unk>
moved to arizona months ago found this spot and fell in love with their parmesan chicken breast among other food items i will would make it for my husband once a week the past few times have been different i think they changed the recipe and the service <unk> has been horrible the employee who worked at the meat counter ignored me for at least min because he was wrapping all the meats in the display at pm and was so rude pissed i spent on two chicken breast the people at fry s and trader joe s are so helpful friendly and consistent won t be going back to aj s
the lunch specials here are great especially the vegetarian menu on fridays the lunch wrap is always a favorite the salad that comes with the vegetarian lunch menu isn t that great but the rice is ok the meals are quick and spicy and the service is very good
made a last minute stop here for dinner before a show didn t have a reservation but the hostess was friendly and able to seat the two of us quickly nice atmosphere and an attractive space our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive we started with the pasta fagioli soup which was good but a bit bland for my taste the complementary focaccia bread they bring to the table was excellent my wife ordered the chicken rollatini parmesan and i got the lasagna both were excellent overall the experience was very enjoyable with great food great service and a beautiful atmosphere the only reason i removed one star was because during our meal a photographer who worked for the resort was going around taking pictures of people in the restaurant and trying to sell the photos i found it a bit tacky
decided to support our southern highlands <unk> was not awful <unk> on the bland side but that s way better than overly seasoned my wife went in to get the food to go but i can see what the other reviewers were saying about the spartan decor owners take minutes to put a little love to design and how hard is it to put some <unk> ll help you guys when you re working as well then i saw the bill listen southern highlands is considered a remote neighborhood places like off the strip set the standard for pricing and i remember an italian restaurant that tried to match their pricing except for one big difference off the strip gets it and they didn t sooo they went out of business owners it s a <unk> tale that you have to take seriously you can t charge super pricing for this type of food i know i know you already got your flyers <unk> guys that s cheap to replace you also have a digital <unk> that is easy wouldn t you rather lower the prices and get more people in than trying to get rich off a few i believe in you guys come on i m rooting for you improve decor food quality and pricing and southern highlands will come
amazing tacos and carne asada fries plan on to go for sure no seating worth the time for take out
went here for a fairly rowdy bachelor party what you are a lady you say nay i am a woman with many a male friend let me continue my story say i and knew well what i was getting into i m trying not to <unk> this review with how very out of my normal happy place a place like dick s is i m a quiet bar good whiskey long <unk> conversation sort of girl dick s <unk> to these things one of our party kept hitting himself in the nuts with the yard long slushie tube around his neck so that was how the night was gonna be and these are my friends i had chosen to be here so it is in that context i review dick s last resort the bachelor in question had a blast so that was the first and foremost goal accomplished our dick waiter was actually quite funny and had the tact to realize who could take and wanted to take the <unk> of his <unk> hint he kept hitting himself in the nuts with a foot slurpee surprise or maybe he just went for the low hanging frozen fruit either way he dished it out pretty evenly with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and then focused like a <unk> laser the show was definitely the best part of the experience and makes me want to hike the review to four stars it s the combination of food beer and price point that prevent me from doing so i had hot wings a side of hooters <unk> which were pretty good the sauce tasted an awful lot like franks <unk> and some mozzerella sticks which <unk> damned tasty after i had my second beer but woah that beer was expensive even for the strip the whole bill was somewhere around for beers and appetizers pre tip for the entertainment yeah the food wasn t that much more amazing than a tgifridays type place less of a frozen gloppy taste but still not worth for wings and mozzarella sticks i knew it was gonna be spendy but at the end of a meh meal it s pretty hard to swallow <unk> down a cool hundred for bud decent entertainment and food you didn t particularly like you go to dicks for the show but be prepared to pay strip inflated prices i think the next time i go i ll eat before i head out there and then my budget won t hurt so bad
great old vegas atmosphere service was attentive we explored only the breakfast menu large portions of food marco polo omelette was more than i could handle in in one sitting but tasty i will definitely return to try out lunch and dinner options
this is the best place to get a philly hands down get the onions and red sauce you won t be disappointed very friendly staff can t beat it
came here with a party of the atmosphere is very nice perfect lighting wine beer bottles all around the menu is very wide lots of special items that you do not find in other japanese restaurants which have turned into buffets prices are not too bad per dish we ordered the medium sushi platter which was huge as well as pork bone soup very good scallop roll chicken yakisoba delicious pork cutlet udon soup and sashimi salad fresh delicious the sushi platter was so huge we actually took home about pieces of sushi probably won t be as tasty as fresh at home food was delicious as mentioned in other reviews they use purple rice which i love more healthy and seems softer price was decent i have nothing bad to say about this place maybe they can wipe the floors a bit more kinda sticky and parking is horrible but that s not their fault because its at that circle where tons of restaurants are situated jack astors brewery etc all fighting for dinner parking spots i ll upload some photos but there s already of them here lol i would definitely come back good restaurant for friends to have a good time
my wife and i had a reservation here before an event across the street at heinz hall the temperature outside was only around zero so it was nice to be able to have dinner and then only have to walk across the street afterwards the restaurant was cramped we were seated at a table for two which was lined up with four other similar tables along one wall a little too cozy our waitress was efficient but she had a lot of tables and was <unk> business like my wife s salmon was good but the beef tips in my pasta special were barely edible fatty gristly our bill was a whopping before the tip we will not go back to bravo franco but we ll be back to heinz hall we saw a <unk> casablanca while the pittsburgh symphony played the musical score a real wow
our friend was craving for a peruvian food so we decided to give this place a shot service was great from the moment we stepped foot in this place we were greeted with a friendly smile and escorted to our table within minutes of walking in waters and drinks took a few minutes but not anything to complain about waitress made some great recommendations and we ended up ordering for our hungry party of appetizers papa a la <unk> potatoes <unk> style potatoes with a peruvian with an aji <unk> cheese sauce this was pretty tasty although i wish it had a bit more punch in the flavor this dish i ve had better at other places although still tasty <unk> con queso fresco large peruvian corn on the cob served with queso fresco and ahi <unk> cheese sauce this isn t your standard corn on the cobb the texture is entirely differently color is a light yellow and the size of the kernels are about times the size of your standard white or yellow corn kernels this is no joke lol the texture is more chewy al dente and that s honestly what i loved so much about it i recommend cutting the corn kernels off the corn and taking a bit with the quest fresco and cheese sauce on it together super noms highly recommend this dish entrees arroz con mariscos peruvian paella i honestly was very leery to try this when the waitress recommended it because i figured it would probably be overcooked the rice would be mushy and overall it would be blah and bland i was more than pleasantly surprised they don t skimp on this dish at all it was a huge plate and the paella was surrounded with beautifully pickled red onions and tomatoes chunks the rice was perfectly cooked still al dente packed full of flavor and loaded with fresh seafood the seafood was perfectly cooked and not rubbery surprisingly it came with baby scallops mussels clams squid octopus and shrimps we eat ate bowls and still had half the dish left to take home highly recommend this dish as well pollo a la <unk> peruvian rotisserie chicken you can order a quarter half or whole order we got the whole chicken and it was awesome i m not a huge fan of dark meat but it was very flavorful moist and juicy the only thing i was missing was the crisp on the skin the fries that it came with were blah but dip the chicken in the two salsas they provide and it s a game changer the white beans it came with were surprisingly delicious too they were more watery but super creamy and packed full of spices and flavor dessert i forgot what they re called but they re essentially flaky buttery shortbread cookies stuffed with dulce de leche they were definitely good but very rich and not anything super special i wouldn t go out of my way to order it but if it was ever in front of me again i would definitely eat it p come give this place a shot my fellow foodie bears i ll definitely be back
pizza is amazing <unk> pizza is the perfect balance of sweet savory and salt definitely a must try meatballs are better than my <unk> s and best i ve had menu is compact but everything is excellent
as an ex <unk> i have a pretty high standard of bagel these did not disappoint but i wouldn t say they are truly singular in their yumminess my review is based solely on these as we did not try the desserts or anything else some of the bagels seemed fresher than others and if you ve ever had a nyc bagel before am you know the expectations i have i also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny and the holes were big i m used to really fat chewy but pillowy ones sigh but it really pains me to give anything lower than stars as they have a lot of traditional jewish nyc deli delicacies which you really don t see out here in lv if that is your thing you really should check it out the rye bread with <unk> seeds looked good the dessert section also piqued my interest please don t get a black white cookie hell will freeze over before anyone ever likes those trust me the shop is located in the weirdest shopping complex it feels like a dr s office belongs here inside it was pretty poppin it was sunday but the line wasn t bad all in all i will be back again to try more
we went there to celebrate valentines day and it was really a bad choice the service was very slow and the tables were half broken we had to fix the table legs ourselves even our neighbours were doing the same it took a really long time to get someone s attention and order i ordered steamed dumplings but they arrived fried my wife was disappointed that there was only one vegetarian dumpling option and even those were not good it was pretty hard to eat them as once you take a bite they all fell apart on a plate or table also the dumpling dough was very thick and tasted weird we were so disappointed about the food that we were <unk> to order more and went to another restaurant right after aroma indian restaurant next door was much better choice i would never come back here
april th pm stay away and keep your money go to the cracker barrel south block or next door to waffle house or little italian place across the street pm worse visit yet to this location no more have been numerous time and this is the end no food for mins and had to track down wait staff no refills during the wait previous visit reported the oj was watered down to water and splash of oj we re a franchise today all eggs over cooked my skillet barely passed kids spaghetti how to you overcook the noodles wait staff could not remember to bring refills or condiments i reported to front desk did not give a crap dont go here go to cracker <unk> block away or to waffle house next door
don t waste your time or money i feel bad about saying it but this place is awful they are understaffed and over run we went there on a friday night and they got of our order right i ordered steak kabobs which came out ice cold i sent them back and minutes later they came out nice and hot unfortunately i could barely chew the pieces of steak on my plate i made sure to have a few people in our party try it to ensure i wasn t just being critical all three people who tried the meat agreed with me i had high hopes walking in but that s not enough maybe they can get adequately staffed and hire a chef if not this place will be here for about days sorry
lovely date spot with great food food took longer than <unk> the kitchen was backed <unk> still had a great dinner
i ve quickly grown fond of this little place they offer a variety of bento boxes and combo plates that are perfect for someone like me who likes to try a little bit of this and that throughout their meal they also have a small sushi menu and some salads perfect for grubbing after the gym the chicken katsu and kalbi plates are a hit with both me and my guy portions are generous and i like subbing their mac salad for the rice since it s not as creamy as other spots and has a nice peppery flavor to it the bento boxes are my favorite to grab and go making a small feast for only about service is polite and food comes out fast they have the door bell style buttons to <unk> the waitstaff to your table which i don t typically like but they re usually attentive enough that i don t have to use it location is small but clean and nicely decorated they usually get pretty busy for lunch
thai basil tofu used to be our favorite here was not the same on our latest visit did not like the way the tofu is coated and fried the texture and flavor was off hope they figure this out even my kids who fight for the tofu in their fried rice picked the tofu out and did not eat it
we had an amazing dinner here today it was my birthday and i checked out this place on a whim spoke to the owner and asked him for a reservation the night prior for pm we just had a <unk> he said at amazing since this place takes orders weeks in advance we were seated in a small area table for two all by ourselves view of the moon and stars occasionally saw waiters filling jugs of water and so forth but no big deal i felt like i was in europe dinner amazing the review would be too long to write but when i shared with friends they said amazing sounds like your house nick i <unk> saying yeah pretty much beautiful preparations beautiful service had a level three sommelier attend to our needs dinner was filling and real of the old country two things they are not byob they do take credit cards don t listen to the previous reviews will we return no doubt the most original con <unk> for cuisine if you want a real memorable meal thanks christian and steven for making years old a memorable year
love the food here great healthy options i especially like the tacos the rice bowl and the tamales the pizzas are good too i haven t gone for happy hour but i heard it is good
i go to this place every week for my watermelon smoothie my first time was for a sundae my boyfriend introduced me to this place and he s cheap so this is a worthy price tasty like promised served with a smile cute little place for a date your kids and cold place to lounge snack if anyone <unk> has entitled a bad review to this place idk where else u would go that meets this place genuine service and great food i highly recommend its simplicity and wonderful atmosphere
the nicest hotel i ve ever stayed in in vegas found a great deal during the week and couldn t pass it up clean staff is friendly and there s so much food to choose from downstairs pretty convenient location on the strip as well definitely will stay here again
we had brunch at lon s today for my parents anniversary it was a really nice experience unfortunately we were unable to sit on the famed patio because it was rainy but we loved the southwestern motif of the dining rooms complete with the kiva fireplaces the art on the walls is obviously fabulous we started with the monkey bread it was delicious absolutely yummy very sugary it was actually swimming in syrup and frosting and then covered with pecans how decadent i actually ate a rd of the dish and was almost completely full i didn t leave myself enough room for the chopped salad full of fresh vegetables i got it without the turkey and cheese but i m assuming if you like that kind of thing it would add something to the dish they were very good about subbing a <unk> egg for the turkey it was dressed lightly with a cilantro vinaigrette and had the crunch of pumpkin seeds throughout i was really surprised with how generous the portion was lon s isn t about charging a good amount for a little bit of food they pile it on my parents both got the lemon ricotta pancakes they weren t anything like the pancakes you are used to they are circular and tall but not in the least bit dense the compote served along with them was the perfect compliment to the lemon of the lemony whipped cream and pancake they probably could have spit an order as they both had leftovers my husband got the lon s club he complimented the bread being a little harder on the outside and soft and warm on the inside it was piled high with chicken breast ham cheese avocado and aoili it came with a side of either salad or french fries and their famous apple slaw he chose the french fries which i was very happy about because they were perfectly cooked and really well seasoned i stole more than a few he said the apple slaw was refreshing it had raisins in it as well we can t wait to go back to lon s the cost of the brunch was very reasonable without tax or tip entrees and a starter coffee and tea
best wings in town we love this place the atmosphere is relaxed the waitresses are excellent and the owner comes and checks in to see if you are enjoying your food there are tons of tvs a fabulous selection of beers and have i mentioned they have amazing wings
the food is ok but much of it is quite greasy the service is either deaf or apathetic even if i tell them give me a minute they ll still keep asking u ready to order or do u need a minute one time she even kept saying hello hello like she couldn t hear anything i said been going here for years but at first when this started i thought she must have bad <unk> or something but now every time i go back i m in the drive they for seconds before she keeps asking again she acts like she hears nothing even after i order <unk> say u ready to order now i know she can hear me bc she only starts talking when i m not the previous times since this started my order has been wrong every time today she won t even acknowledge anything i say even after i ordered and said that s all i wanted she kept asking rudely if i needed a minute and are u ready to order so i just drove thru and went somewhere else to eat they never tell u what ur total is until after u get to the window either they really don t give a crap
i like this place the burgers are good and you can customize them all sorts of ways they even have hot cheese to dip your fries in
review is for sunday s kamayan overall an interesting experience the setup for the food on banana leaf is a performance in itself taking you to another place it s also not everyday we can devour out food with our hands includes various sauces and proteins with garlic rice overall the food was either abit ordinary or a miss the fish was too dry the spare ribs tender the wing over salted rice tasty we felt dessert should have been part of the set but it s ordered ala carte service was great cocktails ok so i would recommend it more for experience than the food
we ate at the n ne steakhouse last night and it was so delicious my husband and i shared a bone in ribeye and a garbage salad the steak was cooked to med rare perfection and melted in your mouth and the salad was perfect as well we shall return
my hubby and i have been here multiple times maybe the past times we went in sat down and were ignored for at least mins so we walked out this happened times i really like this place and the food is good but the waitress s are snotty young girls who seem like you are bothering them by placing an order they could use more seating as well i m sad we won t be coming back
this guy definitely knows how to make pizza it was amazing and was surprised on how good it was this guy has a talent for making pizzas and definitely recommend coming here i was just sad i couldn t get a <unk>
we went here with a certificate from restaurantcom and this place is amazing i have been back twice since we first tried it a week prior we had the cubano sliders the empanadas the pernil asado tacos the short rib barbacoa tacos and the carne asada tacos hands down my absolute favorite dish would have to have been the cubano sliders rolls filed with ham real ham not <unk> pulled pork swiss dijon mustard which tastes like it has horseradish in it very strong so be warned and served with a slide of fantastic sweet potato fries by far the best sweet potato fries i have had in a long time the empanadas were savory and delicious the best kind of empanada is one filled with meat the pernil asado was my favorite of the three tacos we tried not spicy like the short rib but juicy sweet and savory the short rib was delicious as well but spicy the lingering kind of spicy so be prepared i was told that this place was considered mexican food but from experiencing even just the appetizers i would say it s way more cuban than mexican
this is a brunch staple for us the food is always amazing on our most recent visit i got pecan pancakes with a side of sausage my boyfriend got the grilled cheese two wings and tennessee fries we ve had the shrimp and grits waffle omelettes and so much more and it s always great the servers are always friendly we like the community table option and have met a lot of great people just by sitting down and sharing a meal with them this is a great spot and worth the travel from charlotte
the nachos were pretty good mainly the sauce shrimp tacos were decent too nice rooftop patio the dip we had crab was just okay
i had no idea this was a johnny rockets i was over looking the receipt and saw the name on the bottom i was surprised besides that the restaurant was very clean looked good the burgers definitely had a good taste of them but the fries were a bit salty the drink station was pretty cool there were about eight different flavors to enhance your drinks overall next time i want a burger and i m in the area i will probably stop here versus anywhere else great job jr aka johnny rocket
ive been to sugar factory a couple times now and it s always a good experience i came here with a group of for my buddies birthday and we all enjoyed it very much we had to push our reservation back an hour and that was no issue so thank you sugar factory for that i got the factory salad to start and it was good it was a healthy tasting salad with a very light dressing to go with it for dinner i got the double grilled cheese blt with fries and it was great and hot definitely recommend the sandwich but i would pick a different appetizer next time
the culture sandwich is amazing it s my go to vegan lunch the atmosphere is chill plus they make their own almond milk
what are you doing straight flavor bombs waiting to lay waste to your appetite my wife had the fuku lucky burger the game is in the name cause if you this bad boy your in luck i won t even try to explain it for we would be here hours i had the buta burger which is a pork burger which was an fantastic <unk> into where in pork has gone my lord bring your behind and try it you can t go wrong
it s not the best trini food i ve had but its certainly not the worst and its pretty tasty and cheap last time i was there for i walked out with doubles boneless chicken roti dinner extra large oxtail dinner bag of <unk> and sauce the ladies who run the place remind you of your caribbean <unk> who don t take shit but serve good food check it out its so random to find a caribbean place on the danforth let alone one worth eating at
such a nice ambiance food was pretty good but a little greasy the line is extremely long but our concierge <unk> hotel gave us his business card and we were able to cut the line otherwise i don t know if it would ve been worth it our waitress was also very sweet and gave us some good recommendations of things to do in montreal
j ai beaucoup aim l ambiance lumi res <unk> <unk> es grand choix de <unk> et m me de bi res bonne musique bonne vibe seul tout petit <unk> musique un peu forte si on veut <unk>
a very tasty dinner tonight at wongs the food was very good and the service was impressive how you say the restaurant was very busy tonight and they appeared possibly short staffed but you would not have noticed based on how crazy fast the staff was these poor ladies were running around like it was going out of style and they managed to smile the whole time as for the grub app potstickers were good spicy boiled wonton soup was amazing like best soup amazing if u go u need to try entree orange chicken and house chicken were both very good as good as the food was i still can t get over the speed of the ladies tonight well done ladies and if i ever open a restaurant i am <unk> at wongs first
not bad for a sports <unk> to our <unk>
my favorite place to eat at paris the breakfast crepe is amazing for breakfast with eggs turkey avacado and the most delicious <unk> sauce this trip i also tried a nutella crepe with bananas that was insane i could eat these all day the only disappointment is that the wait time can be very long i want to grab these and go still i will be back the next time i m at the paris
went here for dinner with my boss and another co worker the place looks cool from the outside and the host at the front was very friendly and helpful other than the guy playing the guitar tableside the positives stopped here our server was the coolest guy in the room just ask him he ll tell you all about it the food was all terrible it was all cold even the mini cheeseburgers that were brought out because the owner wanted to buy us an appetizer this is a cheesy line they use to make you feel like you re getting something for all of those incredibly overpriced drinks you re buying my boss said he was pretty sure that his prime rib was reheated from the day before and my salmon had an awful odor flavor the cool atmosphere friendly hosts and guitar guy who <unk> ring of fire when we requested it make it worth stopping in at happy hour to buy a reasonably priced drink but otherwise not worth it at all
this is a small restaurant but the owner was nice enough to accommodate people there are no reservations i felt that the koobideh did not have as much flavor as i had hoped their rice was perfect i expected more from the yogurt drink because it was quite watery they offer generous portion sizes and give extra <unk> sauce for free note that you can t substitute rice with fries also the restaurant smelled like cigarette smoke so be wary of that
great spot with a view this resto is easy to find with great patio food and service we came here around pm on a sunday and were seated away the service was fast and our server was very attentive i noticed there were actually a lot of servers and busboys to help out as for the food our table ordered the deep fried brussels sprouts mussels lamb bolognese linguine and pepe pizza everything was very tasty except for the brussels sprouts it was overly fried in my opinion they are also very tiny to begin with so it didn t even taste like brussels sprouts more just crispy flakes of some sort i d prefer them to be lightly fried so at least it tastes like i m biting into a brussels sprout the sauce on the sprout however was on point i will definitely come back here but i m gonna get myself a burger instead it looked really juicy
give me aroma over starbucks any day even though there s one across the street not just because they give you a little square of chocolate with your drink they do not because their coffee is delicious it is not because the place is just so much prettier than starbucks also true i love aroma for their tea love i absolutely hate when i order tea and it s a tea bag that i could buy myself i appreciate real herbs real tea leaves that might be a little bit more difficult for me to prepare at home which is why i love their mint tea mmmmm i also adore their frozen coffees in the summer it s an awesome summer drink with no frills coffee ice milk and i think that s exactly how it should be
this location has poor customer service we placed an order it was wrong twice when checked in the store we ordered chicken cheesesteak and regular cheesesteak on the third attempt we came home min away after being reassured it was correct only to find there were two beef cheesesteaks in the bag we called and the guy that answered appeared not to understand what a chicken cheesesteak was despite this being on the menu my husband returned to the store with the order we received only for the staff to inform him that one was chicken i think everyone knows the difference between chicken and beef needless to say we will not be returning to this location
while here in las vegas need some place to pick up some thing quick for breakfast and decided to get something here first and foremost they have a nice display of pastries and donuts which makes your mouth water not only do they have those yummy pastries on display they also have a decent selection of bagels to choose from and you can get them toasted too price ranges from as low as for a basic donut up to for one of their more dessert options for las vegas hotel prices here are reasonable i ended up getting donuts and bagels to split among my friends overall the bagel was good it was a bit doughy and was expecting more of an east coast bagel than a west coast bagel but after a night of drinking i wasn t complaining the donut are also decent it was more like a cake so it filled the spot with a light glaze on top overall if was a good hangover cure and less expensive than most of the places in vegas so overall stars and worth a stop for a cheap eats in vegas
they have a very large menu everything from soup to sushi everything we have tried there has been made with absolute top quality ingredients presentation is good to very good depending on how busy they are but no matter what it looks like it always tastes perfect
great ordering system great atmosphere great excuse to eat tater tots as an adult i love the variety and amount of topping options here and the sauce selection is superior to any other place i ve visited every time i come to the cleveland area to visit family i make it a point to come out and eat purely awesome can t wait to try a vegan dog
this is a massive hotel and it s a beautiful place to stay in vegas our room was a huge split level with a comfortable seating area near the window the bed was comfortable the room quiet the best part of this resort is the pool area its enormous and well staffed the servers and bartenders were friendly and always made sure guests were taken care of they re happened to a private train concert within the resort so it was nice to enjoy a concert without leaving the resort restaurants were wonderful and so many shops to explore there really is no need to even leave this resort once you re checked in a great place and we ll definitely return
tiny portions and not enough menu options for vegetarians <unk> if you re vegan the only item on the food menu for you is guacamole lol we came on a friday night around pm without a reservation and got extremely lucky to be seated right away super packed in here and pretty loud so definitely make a reservation for the busier nights if you plan on coming and probably not the best place to come to try to catch up with someone because you really have to yell across the table to be heard the price range here is higher than many other mexican places like <unk> mexicana that s a block or two east the guacamole was fresh but tiny for the only vegetarian tacos on the menu last night were poblano ones with cheese and cream taco again super basic and i found it odd how they served my partner these one at a time he ordered lol i love shrimp tacos but these were not on the menu and the only seafood one they had was a beer battered branzino so instead i ordered the ceviche which was pretty spicy and salty although small it did come with a cup of pita chips and i found it sufficient more or less for the night service was spotty nice server but he was covering way too many tables so we rarely saw him had to ask for napkins and never did get that water refill next time partner and i will source our tacos from elsewhere like el local loco the shrimp tacos there are great
i ordered the lunch special any one topping with a drink i got the chicken topping and i must say it was very delicious my food came out in a timely manner as well i love this location because it is something like large cafeteria setting without the grumpy lunch ladies lol will be returning again
i knew it was pricey going in but for a kids grilled cheese literally pieces of bread and a slice of cheese and for a side of mashed potatoes for an year old the food was over priced for the bland dinner i got add to that the fact our medium burger was almost moo ing and i am over it tried to go on a limb try something new what a bust
the peppermill restaurant has been around for such a long time and they know how vegas locals and tourists like it portions here are so big i think you pretty much have to split it with someone or be prepared to take it home prices are reasonable comparing it to the portions you get the only downfall to this place which i feel doesn t take away from the rating is the long wait to get a table some suggestions are to call ahead they are usually willing to put you on the list or hang out at the lounge and start out with cocktails that s never a bad idea we came here for breakfast and the omelettes were huge probably made with eggs and full with ingredients in every bite we will definitely comeback and bring lots of hungry friends
awesome <unk> these patties are great meat tasted really fresh the employee i met was really pleasant overall great experience def recommend to anyone who likes patties and co co bread
i first came to this renovated duckworth s for a yelp event after the event i knew i had to come back for a wednesday beer and burger special my husband and i stopped in last wednesday and sat outside as we had our pup with us side note they brought out a huge bowl of water for him which was so sweet i settled on a glass of wine and my husband got a beer for food i got a build your own salad with lots of fun toppings i will say this salad was <unk> my husband got the impossible burger veggie burg with tots the tots were super tasty the burger was so fun as it definitely tasted like meat to me service was great and food was tasty overall a win
first of all i have got to say i was really impressed with the inside view of the il forno restaurant i came out here a month ago and had dinner here with a friend and his cousins for dinner it was a really small and quiet amount of people here on a saturday night i ordered the spaghetti and meatball dish which was a little bland the italian bread was really good as the staff served us before our dinner was served the restaurant is really small with a good outside view of michaels and several other businesses outside the strip mall restaurants meets right by highway great place to come and dine or hang out with friends will be back again when i have the chance again
i have eaten here many times some of the dishes are amazing others are good i find it hard to remember what i have had to really try everything absolutly recomend back for the humus and the picnic <unk> both fantastic
<unk> up for our annual event finds me on the corner of berkeley queen again this spring and so we dash into the berkeley cafe for a bite of lunch and some respite from a long morning of meetings my affection factor the bc has jumped a star and i ve decided that as small and limited in their hours this is just about one of my most favorite lunch spots in the city it s not cluttered with <unk> a <unk> like so many other garage sale decorated cafes that have popped up all over the city there are no funky smells from old chairs and sofas and there are no greasy dust strings across old lighting fixtures is it a busy spot yup it is a constant stream of coming and going for takeout which in my opinion tells you this is a place that makes decent food the soup of the day was a mexican spicy chipotle lentil soup i asked about getting it in a takeout container because i can never eat all this food in one sitting the waitress suggests i order just a cup size i jump at this suggestion and this soup was damn delicious almost coming across like lentil stew my lunch mate took one look at my soup and promptly ordered up one for herself i ordered an egg salad sandwich with a side salad this was simply one of the best egg salad sandwiches i ve ever had in a cafe red onion fresh dill lots of arugula and bean sprouts on super fresh whole grain bread the side salad was pretty bright and screamed fresh fresh fresh grated carrots beets big chunks of crunchy red peppers spanish onions and cukes atop a bed of spring mix with a light tangy vinaigrette my lunch buddy ordered up a spicy grilled chicken salad topped with feta and dressed with a lemony vinaigrette in addition to this i had an americano at the end of my meal the bill total came to a whopping for both us together best lunch bargain we ve had in ages check out the pics the berkeley cafe is one of my most fave lunch destinations and considering i ll be in that neighbourhood for the next few months i m grateful that they are there fresh delicious food and easy on the pocketbook thank you bc
for a large supreme meat pizza and cheezy sticks seemed extremely expensive especially for a restaurant that you can t sit down in fortunately the quality of the meats and cheese justified the price it s not the best pizza i ve ever had but the quality is definitely worth the price difference between the other pizza delivery chains don t miss the chance to get a pizza at marco s
absolutely wonderful meal the front is a little nondescript but once i found the place i was given the option of a table or a kitchen counter seat i definitely recommend sitting at the kitchen counter and enjoy the show watching the chefs delicately and simply prepare every dish adds another dimension to your meal there were so many options but i opted for the tasting menu which turned out to be more then enough food for i sit here with an <unk> belly remembering the tasty shrimp slight spice to the carrots the <unk> of the paella and the soft layers of potato and egg everything was fantastic and i washed it all down with spicy tequila and a white sangria i will definitely be coming back
huge portions for you get to choose your own soup base noodles and toppings on top of that a few side dishes the food was decent no where near the best i ve had great place to get full with friends but don t expect anything great
decided to order here because it s location is very close to the house and i didn t feel like cooking and when i tell u that was a bad choice to make we ordered the fish and chips shrimp dinner and side salad the fries were so soggy and the fish and shrimp were not cooked all the way it was warm on the outside and cold on the inside this was by far the worst fish i ever tasted and the batter was so mushy and disgusting we had to throw the food away so we wouldn t get sick the only good part was the salad but they forgot our dressing and a fork
come here strictly for the margaritas and tacos yum gets pretty packed here on their busier nights so be prepared to wait a little for your table or a seat at the bar service is good and food is consistent when you re done head across the street to blue martini for additional drinks and dancing
southern kitchen meets fancy urban industrial loft cozy yet loud and lively can t really find better words to describe the decor but somehow it all works we ordered the chicken watermelon and waffles the shrimp grits and the fried oreos for dessert to drink i got the bourbon lemonade and the boyfriend got an old fashioned he s a bit of a snob when it comes to old fashioneds and this place not only met but exceeded his standards everything was delicious the chicken the waffles the watermelon the shrimp and grits all delicious we cleaned off our plates my least favorite thing was the fried oreos but they still weren t bad at all it just means i ll have to try another dessert the next time i m here as good as the food was the service was even better from the hostess the waitress the manager and the bus boy the service here was absolutely on point this place has easily become a favorite and i ll certainly be back the next time i come to vegas
went there tonight it was my second time had great food and amazing service i loved my experience there and would go back i got to try a lot of menu items since we were a group including c wow chocolate dome king kong bubble waffle with pistachio ice cream the best <unk> c caramel hot chocolate drink etc what really blew us away was the shawarma and shish taouk crepe paninis sooooo good for a dessert place we were almost more impressed by the savoury food our waiter was new but he was great very friendly and nice
food as always is good the service on the other hand is very <unk> the girl at the register let us know when we asked if there was a manager available that they were all on vacation so i am guessing that customer service is the last thing this place realy cares about because of the <unk>
i had the omelette and grits let me tell <unk> grits were fantastic the hubby had the burger and fries the bun was toasted to perfection it was a great meal we will definitely return
okay meatballs my average lunch ticket here on several visits far exceed my usually <unk> for daily work lunch average <unk> i have had meatball panini with dipping sauce probably the better item versus the other below choices reason being is that the sandwich must be pressed in a panini press forcing out a hot sandwich still hungry after having this stars meatballs over pasta saucy balls with pasta option meatballs taste okay with the spicy meatballs having the most flavor meatballs in all visits are never hot and lukewarm at best stars tater tots good crunchy and crispy if i crave tator tots i will come here probably will not return due to cold meatballs and high lunch prices for non filling satisfying content
awesome food don t sit close to the kitchen like we did you can see everything they are making and we over ordered because it all looked so great
my experience with this location is don t use the online app to place your order paid for a got a had to drive back to the store and gave me sriracha sauce instead of buffalo for my sale and it was horrible yesterday i went into the shop so i could watch to make sure i get what i asked for and ordered the new chicken caesar melt prepared as advertised did not like it at all and definitely not worth i have been eating at subway for years and the quality and customer service at this location lacks in both looking for another sandwich shop
good but could be better we came in around am closing time was and still received good service and food we ordered the shrimp pizza and blue crab cakes the shrimp on the pizza was good but the dough was paper thin and the crust was tough the crab cakes however were a lot better the presentation was nice and they were packed with a ton of flavor i ve always wanted to try this place and i m happy i did i ll probably give wolfgang pucks another try but with a different dish
